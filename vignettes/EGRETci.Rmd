# Introduction to toxEval
By Laura A. De Cicco, Steven Corsi

This package **toxEval** is an early test version of the package that will encompass the various approaches to evaluate ToxCast data in relation to measured aquatic concentrations.

## Molecular weights
ToxCast reports values in $\mu$M. Data from water samples collected are typically mg/L, ng/L, or pg/L. Therefore, the first step is to determine the molecular weight of the measured data. The package **webchem** supports this functionality. 


```{r}

library("webchem")

inchk <- cts_convert(query = '3380-34-5', from = 'CAS', to = 'inchikey')
info <- cts_compinfo(inchikey = inchk)
info$molweight

```
