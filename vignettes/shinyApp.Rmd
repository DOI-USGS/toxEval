The `toxEval` R-package includes a set of functions to analyze, visualize, and organize measured concentration data as it relates to ToxCast data. These functions allow great flexibly for exploring the potential biological affects of measured chemicals. Also included in the package is a browser-based application made from the `shiny` R-package. There is less customization from the application, but it is a convenient way to explore the data. 

This vignette describes the process to prepare the data and use the shiny application. There is also a section on installing and updating the package, since it is not on CRAN. 

# Preparing the data

The data should be prepared in a Microsoft\textregistered\ Excel file. There are 3 mandatory sheets (also known as tabs), and 2 optional sheets. Each sheet has mandatory columns, but the order is not important. Additional columns can be included but will be ignored. The top row of each sheet should contain the column names (headers), no rows should be initially skipped, and no titles or comments should precede the data. That means

## Data

The "Data" tab needs to have at a minumum 4 columns: "CAS", "SiteID", "Value", and "Sample Date". They can be in any order, but the first row of sheet should be the header names.

* CAS:
* SiteID:
* Value:
* Sample Date:

## Installation of R and RStudio

This section should only need to be done once per computer. The following link walks you through an installation of R and RStudio:

[Installation Instructions](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/installr/)

If you follow those instructions exactly, you should have the USGS R repository (GRAN) added to your R profile. If that step doesn't ring a bell, paste the following into your R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rprofile_path = file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), ".Rprofile")
write('\noptions(repos=c(getOption(\'repos\'),
    CRAN=\'https://cloud.r-project.org\',
    USGS=\'https://owi.usgs.gov/R\'))\n',
      rprofile_path, 
      append =  TRUE)

cat('Your Rprofile has been updated to include GRAN.
    Please restart R for changes to take effect.')
```

*RESTART RSTUDIO!*

## Installation of toxEval

This section should also only have to be done once. It assumes the USGS R repository (GRAN) was added to your R profile as described above.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("toxEval")
```

## Update toxEval

Regularly, it is a good idea to update *ALL* your packages in R. If using RStudio, this is quite easy, there's an Update button in the "Packages" tab. This checks CRAN and GRAN for updates. It is a good idea to click this update regularly.

Within the R-console, packages can be update with the command:
```{r eval=FALSE}
update.packages()
```

## Reporting bugs

## Citing toxEval

This package has not been reviewed and approved as a USGS-product. The implication is that `toxEval` cannot be cited in a publication. Once the software has been reviewed and approved, basic citation information will be available using the function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
citation(package = "toxEval")
```
