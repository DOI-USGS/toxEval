# Preparing the data

Input data for toxEval should be prepared in a Microsoft &trade; Excel file. There are 3 mandatory sheets (also known as tabs), and 2 optional sheets. The sheets should appear as follows (although the order is not important):

![Organize Sheets](tabs.png)

Each sheet has mandatory columns; the order of the columns is not important, but the names of the columns are important. Additional columns can be included but will be ignored. The top row of each sheet should contain the column names (headers), no rows should be initially skipped, and no titles or comment rows should precede the data. 

## Data

The "Data" sheet needs to have at a minimum of 4 columns: "CAS", "SiteID", "Value", and "Sample Date". The columns can be in any order, but the first row of the sheet should be the header (column names).

* CAS: A character column defining the chemicals via their Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry. In the Excel file, pay special attention that no CAS are converted to a Date format. Highlight the column, right-click on the mouse, choose "Format Cells", and choose "Text" as the category to assure they retain their format. The unique CAS values in this column *must* match with the CAS values in the "Chemicals" sheet.

* SiteID: This character column identifies the sites (or sampling locations) of the measurement. The unique "SiteID" values *must* match the "SiteID" values in the "Sites" sheet. There are no requirements on formatting for this column.

* Value: This column is numeric. It *must* be the concentration of the chemical in $\mu$g/L.

* Sample Date: Currently this column only serves to identify unique samples.  Dates and times as formatted in Excel, as well as integer values are acceptable. The actual date and times are not currently used to perform any time series analysis. 

Note: Additional columns may be useful to organize the data. These additional columns will be ignored by `toxEval` and will not influence a `toxEval` analysis.

As an example, the first several rows of a minimal example would look like this:

## Chemicals

The "Chemicals" sheet needs to have at a minimum of 2 columns: "CAS" and "Class". The columns can be in any order, but the first row of the sheet should be the header (column names).

* CAS: A character column defining the chemicals via their Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry. In the Excel file, pay special attention that no CAS are converted to a Date format. Highlight the column, right-click on the mouse, choose "Format Cells", and choose "Text" as the category to assure they retain their format. The unique CAS values in this column *must* match with the CAS values in the "Data" sheet.

* Class: A character column defining the class of chemicals. Most `toxEval` functions will allow groupings by either chemical, class (as defined here), or biological grouping.

Note: Additional columns may be useful to organize the data. These additional columns will be ignored by `toxEval` and will not influence a `toxEval` analysis.

## Sites

The "Sites" sheet needs to have a minimum of 4 columns: "SiteID", "Short Name", "dec_lon", and "dec_lat". The columns can be in any order, but the first row of the sheet should be the header (column names).

* SiteID: This character column identifies the sites (or sampling locations) of the measurement. The unique "SiteID" values *must* match the "SiteID" values in the "Data" sheet. There are no requirements on formatting for this column.

* Short Name: This character column is the name associated with the SiteID that will be used in the graphs and tables. The names should be sufficiently descriptive, but as short as possible to maximize the area on the graph devoted to the data rather than the labels.

* dec_lon: This numeric column is the decimal longitude of the sampling location. It is mainly used for plotting the sampling locations on a map in the Shiny app. Most `toxEval` functions will not require this column.

* dec_lat: This numeric column is the decimal latitude of the sampling location. It is mainly used for plotting the sampling locations on a map in the Shiny app. Most `toxEval` functions will not require this column.

Note: Additional columns may be useful to organize the data. These additional columns will be ignored by `toxEval` and will not influence a `toxEval` analysis.

## Exclude

At times, it may be appropriate to exclude endpionts, chemicals, or specific endpoint:chemical combinations from a data analysis due to lack of relevance to the study objecive or low confidence in specific portions of the data. The optional "Exclude" sheet is used for this purpose. 

The "Exclude" sheet needs to have a minimum of 2 columns: "CAS" and "endPoint". They can be in any order, but the first row of the sheet should be the header (column names).

* endPoint: A character column to define a specific endpoint to ignore in the analysis. If the "CAS" in the corresponding row is empty, the endPoint will be completely excluded from the `toxEval` analysis. For example, if it was decided that TOX21_p53_BLA_p3_ratio was not an appropriate endPoint to consider for a given analysis, it can be excluded by adding it to the Exclude sheet in the endPoint column. If the "CAS" in the corresponding row is NOT empty, only the specific chemical/endPoint combination will be excluded from the analysis. 

* CAS: A character column defining the chemicals via their Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry. If the "endPoint" in the corresponding row is empty, the chemical will be completely excluded from the `toxEval` analysis. For example, consider that blank samples revealed that DEET was contaminated in the sampling method. All DEET measurements can be excluded by adding 134-62-3 to the Exclude sheet in the "CAS" column, leaving the "endPoint" column blank. If the "endPoint" in the corresponding row is NOT empty, only the specific chemical/endPoint combination will be excluded from the analysis.

Note: Additional columns may be useful to organize the data. These additional columns will be ignored by `toxEval` and will not influence a `toxEval` analysis.

## Benchmarks

The "Benchmarks" sheet is optional. The benchmarks sheet can be used to over-ride the ToxCast endpoints. For example, there may be a need to perform similar `toxEval` analysis using EPA aquatic life benchmarks rather than ToxCast endpoints. 

For the functions to work seamlessly with all `toxEval` functions, the "Benchmarks" sheet needs to have a minimum of 5 columns: "CAS", "Chemical", "endPoint", "Value", and "groupCol". They can be in any order, but the first row of the sheet should be the header (column names).

* CAS: A character column defining the chemicals via their Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry. 

* Chemical: A character column defining the name of the chemicals.

* endPoint: A character column naming the benchmark (e.g. "Acute", "Chronic").

* Value: The concentration (in identical units as what is reported in the "Data" sheet) of the benchmark.

* groupCol: A character column that groups endpoints. This is analogous to the Biological groupings from the ToxCast analysis (e.g. "Fish", "Invertebrates").

Note: Additional columns may be useful to organize the data. These additional columns will be ignored by `toxEval` and will not influence a `toxEval` analysis.
