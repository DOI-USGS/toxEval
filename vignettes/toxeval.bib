	abstract = {Over the past 3–4 decades, per capita consumption of personal care products (PCPs) has steadily risen, resulting in increased discharge of the active and inactive ingredients present in these products into wastewater collection systems. PCPs comprise a long list of compounds employed in toothpaste, sunscreen, lotions, soaps, body washes, and insect repellants, among others. While comprehensive toxicological studies are not yet available, an increasing body of literature has shown that PCPs of all classes can impact aquatic wildlife, bacteria, and/or mammalian cells at low concentrations. Ongoing research efforts have identified PCPs in a variety of environmental compartments, including raw wastewater, wastewater effluent, surface water, wastewater solids, sediment, groundwater, and drinking water. Here, an aggregate analysis of over 5000 reported detections was conducted to better understand the distribution of environmentally-relevant PCP concentrations in, and between, these compartments. The distributions were used to identify whether aggregated environmentally-relevant concentration ranges intersected with available toxicity data. For raw wastewater, wastewater effluent, and surface water, a clear overlap was present between the 25th–75th percentiles and identified toxicity levels. This analysis suggests that improved wastewater treatment of antimicrobials, UV filters, and polycyclic musks is required to prevent negative impacts on aquatic species.},

	abstract = {Nonylphenol and its ethoxylates are on the second priority substances list (PSL2) to determine if they are ‘toxic’ as defined under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. This study addresses the need for data on their occurrence in surface waters and sediments in Canada. Samples of surface water from 35 sites in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin and the upper St. Lawrence River were analyzed for 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE1), nonylphenol diethoxylate (NPE2) and 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP). Bottom sediment samples from nine heavily industrialized sites were also analyzed for the same chemicals. Measurable quantities of 4-NP and 4-t-OP were found in 24\% of all water samples. Values ranged from {\textless}0.010 μg to 0.92 μg/l and from {\textless}0.005 to 0.084 μg/l for 4-NP and 4-t-OP, respectively. Of the surface water samples, 58\% were found to contain NPE1 and 32\% contained NPE2. Their concentrations ranged from {\textless}0.020 to 7.8 μg/l for NPE1 and from {\textless}0.020 to 10 μg/l for NPE2. All nine sediment samples contained 4-nonylphenol, with values ranging from 0.17 to 72 μg/g (dry weight). The majority of sediment samples also contained detectable levels of the other contaminants. A total of 66\% of sediments had detectable amounts of NPE1 and concentrations ranged from {\textless}0.015 to 38 μg/g (dry weight), 66\% of sediments had detectable amounts of NPE2 and values ranged from {\textless}0.015 to 6.0 μg/g (dry weight) and 89\% of sediment samples had detectable amounts of 4-t-OP and values ranged from {\textless}0.010 to 1.8 μg/g (dry weight). The highest concentrations of the analytes found are well below acute toxicity thresholds, but in some cases there may be cause for concern with regard to long-term effects on reproductive health of fish.},

	abstract = {The estrogenic activity of compounds was evaluated in a comparative approach both with in vitro and in vivo assays. By comparing simultaneously obtained experimental data, we evaluated the differences in response sensitivity (by EC10) and concentration–response relationships (including EC50) in order to get an idea about the predictive value of in vitro assays for in vivo estrogenic potencies or effects in fish. Two human estrogen receptor-based assays, the MVLN-assay (transformed MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line) and the yeast estrogen screen (YES-screen) were used for the in vitro evaluation of the estrogenic potencies. An in vivo model with the female zebrafish (Danio rerio) with plasma vitellogenin (VTG) as a biomarker for exposure and the ovarian somatic index (OSI) as an effect endpoint was used for the in vivo work. Compounds tested were 17β-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and the alkylphenolic compound nonylphenol (NP). All compounds were found to be estrogenic in both in vitro assays and were able to induce VTG and to reduce the ovarian somatic index in female zebrafish. The MVLN-assay appeared up to 15 times more sensitive than the YES-screen. Concentration–response relationships, determined by EC10 and EC50 (concentration of test compound causing 10\% or 50\% effect compared to control) for VTG and OSI were of the same order of magnitude, indicating that VTG induction as an exposure biomarker can be predictive for effects on ovaries in females. We further demonstrated that for E1 and NP, the in vitro observed estrogenic potencies, based on EC50 values, were of the same order of magnitude as the in vivo estrogenic potencies. For EE2, a difference between in vitro and in vivo relative estrogenic potency was observed, being about 25 times more potent in vivo than could be expected based on the in vitro results. These experimental results showed the suitability of in vitro assays for screening purposes with qualitative assessment of estrogenicity, but they meanwhile point to the need of in vivo tests for an accurate hazard assessment for wildlife.},

	abstract = {Urban streams are an integral part of the municipal water cycle and provide a point of discharge for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, allowing additional attenuation through dilution and transformation processes, as well as a conduit for transporting contaminants to downstream water supplies. Domestic and commercial activities dispose of wastes down-the-drain, resulting in wastewater containing complex chemical mixtures that are only partially removed during treatment. A key issue associated with WWTP effluent discharge into streams is the potential to cause endocrine disruption in fish. This study provides a long-term (1999–2009) evaluation of the occurrence of alkylphenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and other contaminants discharged from WWTPs into streams in the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi River Regions (Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio). The Greater Metropolitan Chicago Area Waterways, Illinois, were evaluated to determine contaminant concentrations in the major WWTP effluents and receiving streams, and assess the behavior of EDCs from their sources within the sewer collection system, through the major treatment unit processes at a WWTP, to their persistence and transport in the receiving stream. Water samples were analyzed for alkylphenolic EDCs and other contaminants, including 4-nonylphenol (NP), 4-nonylphenolpolyethoxylates (NPEO), 4-nonylphenolethoxycarboxylic acids (NPEC), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), 4-tert-octylphenolpolyethoxylates (OPEO), bisphenol A, triclosan, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and trace elements. All of the compounds were detected in all of the WWTP effluents, with EDTA and NPEC having the greatest concentrations. The compounds also were detected in the WWTP effluent dominated rivers. Multiple fish species were collected from river and lake sites and analyzed for NP, NPEO, NPEC, OP, and OPEO. Whole-body fish tissue analysis indicated widespread occurrence of alkylphenolic compounds, with the highest concentrations occurring in streams with the greatest WWTP effluent content. Biomarkers of endocrine disruption in the fish indicated long-term exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the wastewater impacted urban waterways.},

	abstract = {Assessment of potential risks of complex contaminant mixtures in the environment requires integrated chemical and biological approaches. In support of the US Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, the US Environmental Protection Agency lab in Duluth, MN, is developing these types of methods for assessing possible risks of aquatic contaminants in near-shore Great Lakes (USA) sites. One component involves an exposure system for caged fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) adults suitable for the wide range of habitat and deployment situations encountered in and around the Great Lakes. To complement the fish exposure system, the authors developed an automated device for collection of composite water samples that could be simultaneously deployed with the cages and reflect a temporally integrated exposure of the animals. The present study describes methodological details of the design, construction, and deployment of a flexible yet comparatively inexpensive ({\textless}600 USD) caged-fish/autosampler system. The utility and performance of the system were demonstrated with data collected from deployments at several Great Lakes sites. For example, over 3 field seasons, only 2 of 130 deployed cages were lost, and approximately 99\% of successfully deployed adult fish were recovered after exposures of 4 d or longer. A number of molecular, biochemical, and apical endpoints were successfully measured in recovered animals, changes in which reflected known characteristics of the study sites (e.g., upregulation of hepatic genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism in fish held in the vicinity of wastewater treatment plants). The automated composite samplers proved robust with regard to successful water collection ({\textgreater}95\% of deployed units in the latest field season), and low within- and among-unit variations were found relative to programmed collection volumes. Overall, the test system has excellent potential for integrated chemical–biological monitoring of contaminants in a variety of field settings. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:1584–1595. © 2014 SETAC},

Caged male and female FHMs were deployed at a Great Lakes area of concern during multiple periods (pre-, during, and post-shutdown) near the outflow for a wastewater treatment plant. Influent to this plant is typically 40\% PPM effluent by volume. Additional FHMs were exposed to reference lake water under laboratory conditions. A bioassay using T47D-KBluc cells showed that estrogenic activity of receiving water near the outflow declined by 46\% during the shutdown. We then used 1H NMR spectroscopy and principal component analysis to profile abundances of hepatic endogenous metabolites for FHMs. Profiles for males deployed pre-shutdown in receiving water were significantly different from those for laboratory-control males. Profiles were not significantly different for males deployed during the shutdown, but they were significant again for those deployed post-shutdown. Impacts of treated effluent from this PPM were sex-specific, as differences among profiles of females were largely nonsignificant. Thus, we demonstrate the potential utility of field-based metabolomics for performing biologically based exposure monitoring and evaluating remediation efforts occurring throughout the Great Lakes and other ecosystems.},

Instead, individual outcomes such as pericardial edema and yolk sac edema were more reliable indicators of developmental toxicity. In addition, we ranked the chemicals based on toxicity with the Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) program and via a teratogenic ratio, and found that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) had the highest ToxPi score, triphenyltin acetate had the highest average ToxPi score (corrected for missing data and having more than 4 outcomes), and N-methyl-dithiocarbamate had the highest teratogenic ratio.},

Tissues from a subsample of the adult females that provided eggs were similarly analyzed. Significant relations were found between embryonic mortality (eggs dying between fertilization and hatch) and the concentrations of total PCBs in both the eggs and adults. PCB concentrations were also negatively correlated with the percentage of normal fry that successfully hatched, but no relation was found between PCB residues and fry mortality. Pattern recognition analysis indicated that the PCB congener fingerprint for eggs from Lake Superior was different than that of eggs from Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario. A difference between PCB residue patterns was also identified between eggs and the parent fish. While this difference indicated some preferential deposition of congeners in the eggs, the difference was not attributed to the toxic AHH-active congeners. No difference in the PCB pattern was observed over the 10 years of sample collection, demonstrating that concentrations of individual congeners are declining at similar rates.},

The cells were incubated for 30 min and 4 h with pesticides at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 100 μg/ml, or with the same compounds mixed as follows: (a) dimethoate-diazinon-azinphos; (b) benomyl-pirimiphos; (c) all together. Pesticides in the mixtures were at the same concentration used when tested singly. Diazinon, azinphos-methyl and pirimiphos, but not dimethoate and benomyl, inhibited acetylcholine esterase (AchE) activity, whereas all the compounds inhibited protein synthesis in the following order: benomyl \&gt; azinphos \&gt; diazinon: ⪢ pirimiphos = dimethoate. The mixtures showed a toxicity on AchE activity at a maximum equal to that of the most active compound in the mixture. On the contrary, the mixtures were more toxic than the single compounds on protein synthesis, and in certain cases potentiation occurred. Therefore, we can conclude that it is not feasible to predict the toxicity of pesticide mixtures on the basis of the results of the toxicity of single components.},

	abstract = {Experiments were conducted to assess the in vivo potency of binary mixtures of estrogenic chemicals using plasma vitellogenin (VTG) concentrations in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as the endpoint. The estrogenic potencies of estradiol-17β (E2), 4-tert-nonylphenol (NP), and methoxychlor (MXC) were determined following 14 day exposures to the individual chemicals and binary mixtures of these chemicals. E2, NP, and MXC all induced concentration dependent increases in plasma VTG, with lowest observed effect concentrations of 4.7 and 7.9 ng L-1 for E2, 6.1 and 6.4 μg L-1 for NP, and 4.4 and 6.5 μg L-1 for MXC. Concentration-response curves for fixed ratio binary mixtures of E2 and NP (1:1000), E2 and MXC (1: 1000), and NP and MXC (1:1) were compared to those obtained for the individual chemicals, using the model of concentration addition. Mixtures of E2 and NP were additive at the concentrations tested, but mixtures of E2 and MXC were less than additive. This suggests that while NP probably acts via the same mechanism as E2 in inducing VTG synthesis, MXC may be acting via a different mechanism(s), possibly as a result of its conversion to HPTE which is an estrogen receptor α agonist and an estrogen receptor β antagonist. It was not possible to determine whether mixtures of MXC and NP were additive using VTG induction, because the toxicity of MXC restricted the effect range for which the expected response curve for the binary mixture could be calculated. The data presented illustrate that the model of concentration addition can accurately predict effects on VTG induction, where we know that both chemicals act via the same mechanism in mediating a vitellogenic response.},

	abstract = {For decades, studies of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have challenged traditional concepts in toxicology, in particular the dogma of "the dose makes the poison," because EDCs can have effects at low doses that are not predicted by effects at higher doses. Here, we review two major concepts in EDC studies: low dose and nonmonotonicity. Low-dose effects were defined by the National Toxicology Program as those that occur in the range of human exposures or effects observed at doses below those used for traditional toxicological studies. Wereview the mechanistic data for low-dose effects and use a weight-of-evidence approach to analyze five examples from the EDC literature. Additionally, we explore nonmonotonic dose-response curves, defined as a nonlinear relationship between dose and effect where the slope of the curve changes sign somewhere within the range of doses examined. We provide a detailed discussion of the mechanisms responsible for generating these phenomena, plus hundreds of examples from the cell culture, animal, and epidemiology literature. We illustrate that nonmonotonic responses and low-dose effects are remarkably common in studies of natural hormones and EDCs. Whether low doses of EDCs influence certain human disorders is no longer conjecture, because epidemiological studies show that environmental exposures to EDCs are associated with human diseases and disabilities. We conclude that when nonmonotonic dose-response curves occur, the effects of low doses cannot be predicted by the effects observed at high doses. Thus, fundamental changes in chemical testing and safety determination are needed to protect human health. © 2012 by The Endocrine Society.},

	abstract = {Humans are increasingly and consistently exposed to a variety of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), chemicals that have been linked to neurobehavioral disorders such as ADHD and autism. Many of such EDCs have been shown to adversely influence brain mesocorticolimbic systems raising the potential for cumulative toxicity. As such, understanding the effects of developmental exposure to mixtures of EDCs is critical to public health protection. Consequently, this study compared the effects of a mixture of four EDCs to their effects alone to examine potential for enhanced toxicity, using behavioral domains and paradigms known to be mediated by mesocorticolimbic circuits (fixed interval (FI) schedule controlled behavior, novel object recognition memory and locomotor activity) in offspring of pregnant mice that had been exposed to vehicle or relatively low doses of four EDCs, atrazine (ATR - 10. mg/kg), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA - 0.1. mg/kg), bisphenol-A (BPA - 50. μg/kg), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD - 0.25. μg/kg) alone or combined in a mixture (MIX), from gestational day 7 until weaning. EDC-treated males maintained significantly higher horizontal activity levels across three testing sessions, indicative of delayed habituation, whereas no effects were found in females. Statistically significant effects of MIX were seen in males, but not females, in the form of increased FI response rates, in contrast to reductions in response rate with ATR, BPA and TCDD, and reduced short term memory in the novel object recognition paradigm. MIX also reversed the typically lower neophobia levels of males compared to females. With respect to individual EDCs, TCDD produced notable increases in FI response rates in females, and PFOA significantly increased ambulatory locomotor activity in males. Collectively, these findings show the potential for enhanced behavioral effects of EDC mixtures in males and underscore the need for animal studies to fully investigate mixtures, including chemicals that converge on common physiological substrates to examine potential mechanisms of toxicity with full dose effect curves to assist in interpretations of relevant mechanisms.},

In fact, hormones are known to circulate in the part-per-trillion and part-per-billion concentrations, making them highly effective and potent signaling molecules. Many endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) mimic hormones, yet there is strong debate over whether these chemicals can also have effects at low doses. In the 1990s, scientists proposed the "low-dose hypothesis," which postulated that EDCs affect humans and animals at environmentally relevant doses. This chapter focuses on data that support and refute the low-dose hypothesis. A case study examining the highly controversial example of bisphenol A and its low-dose effects on the prostate is examined through the lens of endocrinology. Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of factors that can influence the ability of a study to detect and interpret low-dose effects appropriately. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We found that the physical properties of chemicals (BCF or log P) did not fully predict lethality or developmental outcomes. Instead, individual outcomes such as pericardial edema and yolk sac edema were more reliable indicators of developmental toxicity. In addition, we ranked the chemicals based on toxicity with the Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) program and via a teratogenic ratio, and found that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) had the highest ToxPi score, triphenyltin acetate had the highest average ToxPi score (corrected for missing data and having more than 4 outcomes), and N-methyl-dithiocarbamate had the highest teratogenic ratio.},

Herein, we describe an ongoing multiagency effort to develop and implement EBMS tools, particularly with regard to monitoring potentially toxic chemicals and assessing Areas of Concern (AOCs), as envisioned by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). Our strategy includes use of both targeted and open-ended/discovery techniques, as appropriate to the amount of information available, to guide a priori end point and/or assay selection. Specifically, a combination of in vivo and in vitro tools is employed by using both wild and caged fish (in vivo), and a variety of receptor- and cell-based assays (in vitro). We employ a work flow that progressively emphasizes in vitro tools for long-term or high-intensity monitoring because of their greater practicality (e.g., lower cost, labor) and relying on in vivo assays for initial surveillance and verification. Our strategy takes advantage of the strengths of a diversity of tools, balancing the depth, breadth, and specificity of information they provide against their costs, transferability, and practicality. Finally, a series of illustrative scenarios is examined that align EBMS options with management goals to illustrate the adaptability and scaling of EBMS approaches and how they can be used in management decisions.

However, our understanding of the circumstances under which spiders are effective sentinels of aquatic pollution is limited. The present study tests the hypothesis that riparian spiders may be effectively used to track spatial patterns of sediment pollution by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in aquatic ecosystems with high habitat heterogeneity. The spatial pattern of ΣPCB concentrations in 2 common families of riparian spiders sampled in 2011 to 2013 generally tracked spatial variation in sediment ΣPCBs across all sites within the Manistique River Great Lakes Area of Concern (AOC), a rivermouth ecosystem located on the south shore of the Upper Peninsula, Manistique (MI, USA) that includes harbor, river, backwater, and lake habitats. Sediment ΣPCB concentrations normalized for total organic carbon explained 41\% of the variation in lipid-normalized spider ΣPCB concentrations across 11 sites. Furthermore, 2 common riparian spider taxa (Araneidae and Tetragnathidae) were highly correlated (r2 {\textgreater} 0.78) and had similar mean ΣPCB concentrations when averaged across all years. The results indicate that riparian spiders may be useful sentinels of relative PCB availability to aquatic and riparian food webs in heterogeneous aquatic ecosystems like rivermouths where habitat and contaminant variability may make the use of aquatic taxa less effective. Furthermore, the present approach appears robust to heterogeneity in shoreline development and riparian vegetation that support different families of large web-building spiders.

	abstract = {Environmental quality monitoring of water resources is challenged with providing the basis for safeguarding the environment against adverse biological effects of anthropogenic chemical contamination from diffuse and point sources. While current regulatory efforts focus on monitoring and assessing a few legacy chemicals, many more anthropogenic chemicals can be detected simultaneously in our aquatic resources. However, exposure to chemical mixtures does not necessarily translate into adverse biological effects nor clearly shows whether mitigation measures are needed. Thus, the question which mixtures are present and which have associated combined effects becomes central for defining adequate monitoring and assessment strategies. Here we describe the vision of the international, EU-funded project SOLUTIONS, where three routes are explored to link the occurrence of chemical mixtures at specific sites to the assessment of adverse biological combination effects. First of all, multi-residue target and non-target screening techniques covering a broader range of anticipated chemicals co-occurring in the environment are being developed. By improving sensitivity and detection limits for known bioactive compounds of concern, new analytical chemistry data for multiple components can be obtained and used to characterise priority mixtures. This information on chemical occurrence will be used to predict mixture toxicity and to derive combined effect estimates suitable for advancing environmental quality standards. Secondly, bioanalytical tools will be explored to provide aggregate bioactivity measures integrating all components that produce common (adverse) outcomes even for mixtures of varying compositions. The ambition is to provide comprehensive arrays of effect-based tools and trait-based field observations that link multiple chemical exposures to various environmental protection goals more directly and to provide improved in situ observations for impact assessment of mixtures. Thirdly, effect-directed analysis (EDA) will be applied to identify major drivers of mixture toxicity. Refinements of EDA include the use of statistical approaches with monitoring information for guidance of experimental EDA studies. These three approaches will be explored using case studies at the Danube and Rhine river basins as well as rivers of the Iberian Peninsula. The synthesis of findings will be organised to provide guidance for future solution-oriented environmental monitoring and explore more systematic ways to assess mixture exposures and combination effects in future water quality monitoring.},

	abstract = {In this study we propose for the first time an approach for the tentative derivation of effect-based water quality trigger values for an apical endpoint, the cytotoxicity measured by the bioluminescence inhibition in Vibrio fischeri. The trigger values were derived for the Australian Drinking Water Guideline and the Australian Guideline for Water Recycling as examples, but the algorithm can be adapted to any other set of guideline values. In the first step, a Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) describing the 50\% effect concentrations, EC50, was established using chemicals known to act according to the nonspecific mode of action of baseline toxicity. This QSAR described the effect of most of the chemicals in these guidelines satisfactorily, with the exception of antibiotics, which were more potent than predicted by the baseline toxicity QSAR. The mixture effect of 10–56 guideline chemicals mixed at various fixed concentration ratios (equipotent mixture ratios and ratios of the guideline values) was adequately described by concentration addition model of mixture toxicity. Ten water samples were then analysed and 5–64 regulated chemicals were detected (from a target list of over 200 chemicals). These detected chemicals were mixed in the ratios of concentrations detected and their mixture effect was predicted by concentration addition. Comparing the effect of these designed mixtures with the effect of the water samples, it became evident that less than 1\% of effect could be explained by known chemicals, making it imperative to derive effect-based trigger values. The effect-based water quality trigger value, EBT-EC50, was calculated from the mixture effect concentration predicted for concentration-additive mixture effects of all chemicals in a given guideline divided by the sum of the guideline concentrations for individual components, and dividing by an extrapolation factor that accounts for the number of chemicals contained in the guidelines and for model uncertainties. While this concept was established using the example of Australian recycled water, it can be easily adapted to any other set of water quality guidelines for organic micropollutants. The cytotoxicity based trigger value cannot be used in isolation, it must be applied in conjunction with effect-based trigger values targeting critical specific modes of action such as estrogenicity or photosynthesis inhibition.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous assessment of sediment chemistry, sediment toxicity, and macroinvertebrate communities can provide multiple lines of evidence when investigating relations between sediment contaminants and ecological degradation. These three measures were evaluated at 99 wadable stream sites across 11 states in the Midwestern United States during the summer of 2013 to assess sediment pollution across a large agricultural landscape. This evaluation considers an extensive suite of sediment chemistry totaling 274 analytes (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, trace elements, and current-use pesticides) and a mixture assessment based on the ratios of detected compounds to available effects-based benchmarks. The sediments were tested for toxicity with the amphipod Hyalella azteca (28-d exposure), the midge Chironomus dilutus (10-d), and, at a few sites, with the freshwater mussel Lampsilis siliquoidea (28-d). Sediment concentrations, normalized to organic carbon content, infrequently exceeded benchmarks for aquatic health, which was generally consistent with low rates of observed toxicity. However, the benchmark-based mixture score and the pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin were significantly related to observed sediment toxicity. The sediment mixture score and bifenthrin were also significant predictors of the upper limits of several univariate measures of the macroinvertebrate community (EPT percent, MMI (Macroinvertebrate Multimetric Index) Score, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera richness) using quantile regression. Multivariate pattern matching (Mantel-like tests) of macroinvertebrate species per site to identified contaminant metrics and sediment toxicity also indicate that the sediment mixture score and bifenthrin have weak, albeit significant, influence on the observed invertebrate community composition. Together, these three lines of evidence (toxicity tests, univariate metrics, and multivariate community analysis) suggest that elevated contaminant concentrations in sediments, in particular bifenthrin, is limiting macroinvertebrate communities in several of these Midwest streams.},

	abstract = {Even in separate sewer systems, wastewater may find its way into the receiving waters through stormwater sewers. The main reasons for this are cross-connections, illicit connections, overflows and leakages through broken sewers. Such discharges may affect receiving water quality and increase risks to public health and aquatic organisms. Detecting wastewater contamination and locating its points of ingress into storm sewer systems can be a challenging task, which should be addressed using proper methods and indicator parameters. A number of detection methods have already been proposed in this area, yet there is a lack of a general overview of such methods. This literature review summarizes and evaluates the methods used for detecting wastewater in stormwater, including those recently developed. The advantages, weaknesses and limitations of individual methods are discussed. It is concluded that while no single method can as yet produce results in a precise, fast and inexpensive way, the use of human waste specific chemical and microbiological markers, and their innovative sampling, offer the way forward. Guidance for selecting the most effective combinations of detection methods, under specific conditions, is also provided.},

	abstract = {Ill-defined, multi-component mixtures of steroidal pharmaceuticals are present in the aquatic environment. Fish are extremely sensitive to some of these steroids. It is important to know how fish respond to these mixtures, and from that knowledge develop methodology that enables accurate prediction of those responses. To provide some of the data required to reach this objective, pairs of fish were first exposed to five different synthetic steroidal pharmaceuticals (one estrogen, EE2; one androgen, trenbolone; one glucocorticoid, beclomethasone dipropionate; and two progestogens, desogestrel and levonorgestrel) and concentration-response data on egg production obtained. Based on those concentration-response relationships, a five component mixture was designed and tested twice. Very similar effects were observed in the two experiments. The mixture inhibited egg production in an additive manner predicted better by the model of Independent Action than that of Concentration Addition. Our data provide a reference case for independent action in an in vivo model. A significant combined effect was observed when each steroidal pharmaceutical in the mixture was present at a concentration which on its own would produce no statistically significant effect (something from ‘nothing’). Further, when each component was present in the mixture at a concentration expected to inhibit egg production by between 18\% (Beclomethasone diproprionate) and 40\% (trenbolone), this mixture almost completely inhibited egg production: a phenomenon we term ‘a lot from a little’. The results from this proof-of-principle study suggest that multiple steroids present in the aquatic environment can be analysed for their potential combined environmental risk.},

	abstract = {Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) include several classes of organic chemicals that are used to treat human and animal diseases and improve the quality of life. The production and consumption of these compounds plays a vital role in improving the economies of many countries and in increasing population growth. However, the extensive use of these compounds in recent years has led to their accumulation in our ecosystem and they are now found in living organisms through their involvement in food chains and food webs. As these compounds are bioactive in nature, they have potential toxicological and hazardous effects on ecological systems, environments, and human health. The high consumption of PPCPs may lead to the pollution of ecological environments worldwide. PPCPs are directly or indirectly excreted from humans in the form of sweat, urine, and feces, which are washed down drains and into sewerage systems, where they are released in urban and industrial wastewater and from wastewater treatment plants, owing to the incomplete removal of effluent. PPCPs that are widely detected in the environment include various medications used in human healthcare, such as clofibrate (for the treatment of hyperlipemia) and medications used for the treatment of inflammation and mild to moderate pain and fever, such as paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac) and their metabolites. These chemicals are frequently detected in different water bodies, and are then further spread by the water cycle to other sources, such as drinking water, lakes, rivers, and groundwater. In this chapter we review the current worldwide status of PPCP pollution in various ecosystems, including rivers, surface water, sewage, and soil. We describe the adverse effects of PPCPs on humans and on the environment, and we outline the toxicity and biodegradation status of PPCPs, as well as reporting risk assessments regarding their use.},

Despite these advancements, significant obstacles still prevent comprehensive assessments of the environmental risks associated with the presence of CECs. Many of these obstacles center around the extrapolation of effects of single chemicals observed in the laboratory or effects found in individual organisms or species in the field to impacts of multiple stressors on aquatic food webs. In the present review, we identify 5 challenges that must be addressed to promote studies of CECs from singular exposure events to multispecies aquatic food web interactions. There needs to be: 1) more detailed information on the complexity of mixtures of CECs in the aquatic environment, 2) a greater understanding of the sublethal effects of CECs on a wide range of aquatic organisms, 3) an ascertaining of the biological consequences of variable duration CEC exposures within and across generations in aquatic species, 4) a linkage of multiple stressors with CEC exposure in aquatic systems, and 5) a documenting of the trophic consequences of CEC exposure across aquatic food webs.

This work uses recent concentrations of PCBs in tributary and open lake water, air, and sediment to calculate an updated mass budget. Five of the 11 LMMBP tributaries were revisited in 2015. In these five tributaries, the geometric mean concentrations of ∑PCBs (sum of 85 congeners) ranged from 1.52 to 22.4 ng L–1. The highest concentrations of PCBs were generally found in the Lower Fox River and in the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal. The input flows of ∑PCBs from wet deposition, dry deposition, tributary loading, and air to water exchange, and the output flows due to sediment burial, volatilization from water to air, and transport to Lake Huron and through the Chicago Diversion were calculated, as well as flows related to the internal processes of settling, resuspension, and sediment–water diffusion. The net transfer of ∑PCBs is 1240 ± 531 kg yr–1 out of the lake. This net transfer is 46\% lower than that estimated in 1994–1995. PCB concentrations in most matrices in the lake are decreasing, which drove the decline of all the individual input and output flows. Atmospheric deposition has become negligible, while volatilization from the water surface is still a major route of loss, releasing PCBs from the lake into the air. Large masses of PCBs remain in the water column and surface sediments and are likely to contribute to the future efflux of PCBs from the lake to the air.},

An isotopic mixing model based on mass-dependent (MDF) and mass-independent fractionation (MIF) (δ202Hg and Δ199Hg) identified three primary Hg sources for sediments: atmospheric, industrial, and watershed-derived. Results indicate atmospheric sources dominate in Lakes Huron, Superior, and Michigan sediments while watershed-derived and industrial sources dominate in Lakes Erie and Ontario sediments. Anomalous Δ200Hg signatures, also apparent in sediments, provided independent validation of the model. Comparison of Δ200Hg signatures in predatory fish from three lakes reveals that bioaccumulated Hg is more isotopically similar to atmospherically derived Hg than a lake’s sediment. Previous research suggests Δ200Hg is conserved during biogeochemical processing and odd mass-independent fractionation (MIF) is conserved during metabolic processing, so it is suspected even is similarly conserved. Given these assumptions, our data suggest that in some cases, atmospherically derived Hg may be a more important source of MeHg to higher trophic levels than legacy sediments in the Great Lakes.},

	abstract = {Background:The North American Great Lakes are home to {\textgreater} 140 types of fish and are famous for recreational and commercial fishing. However, the presence of toxic substances has resulted in the issuance of fish consumption advisories that are typically based on the most restrictive contaminant.Objectives:We investigated whether these advisories, which typically neglect the existence of a mixture of chemicals and their possible additive adverse effects, are adequately protective of the health of humans consuming fish from the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes.Methods:Using recent fish contaminant monitoring data collected by the government of Ontario, Canada, we simulated advisories using most-restrictive-contaminant (one-chem) and multi-contaminant additive effect (multi-chem) approaches. The advisories from the two simulations were compared to determine if there is any deficiency in the currently issued advisories.Results:Approximately half of the advisories currently issued are potentially not adequately protective. Of the four Great Lakes studied, the highest percentage of advisories affected are in Lake Ontario if an additive effect is considered. Many fish that are popular for consumption, such as walleye, salmon, bass and trout, would have noticeably more stringent advisories.Conclusions:Improvements in the advisories may be needed to ensure that the health of humans consuming fish from the Great Lakes is protected. In this region, total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury are the major contaminants causing restrictions on consuming fish, whereas dioxins/furans, toxaphene, and mirex/photomirex are of minor concern. Regular monitoring of most organochlorine pesticides and metals in fish can be discontinued.Citation:Gandhi N, Drouillard KG, Arhonditsis GB, Gewurtz SB, Bhavsar SP. 2017.

The results provide information identified as critical by regulators to assess the “bird or animal deformity or reproductive problems” beneficial use impairment. Eggs were collected from 69 sites across all 5 Great Lakes, including 27 Areas of Concern (AOCs), some with multiple sites, and 10 sites not listed as an AOC. Concentrations of organic contaminants in eggs were quantified and compared with background and reproductive effect thresholds. Approximately 30\% of AOCs had geometric mean concentrations of total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at or below average background exposure (0.34 μg/g wet wt). Exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) was minimal, and only 3 of 27 AOCs and 1 non-AOC had geometric mean concentrations that exceeded background for tree swallows (96 ng/g wet wt). Concentrations of both PCBs and PBDEs were 10 to 20 times below the lower limit associated with impaired hatching success. In contrast, geometric mean concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and furan (PCDD-F) toxic equivalents (TEQs) at the Saginaw River and Bay AOC and Midland, Michigan, USA (a non-AOC site), exceeded the lower limit for hatching effects (181 pg/g PCDD-F TEQs). The rest of the sites had geometric mean concentrations of PCDD-F TEQs below background levels (87 pg/g PCDD-F TEQs).

Standard addition and internal standardization were used for quantification. Results were reported (± SE) for perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs), and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylates (8:2 and 10:2 FTUCA). The lowest average concentration of ∑PFC was found in samples from Lake Superior (13 ± 1 ng g-1), while the highest average concentration was found in samples from Lake Erie (152 ± 14 ng g-1). Samples from Lake Ontario (60 ± 5 ng g-1) and Lake Huron (58 ± 10 ng g-1) showed similar average ∑PFC concentrations, although the perfluorinated sulfonate/carboxylate ratios were different. The major perfluoroalkyl contaminant observed was perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with the highest concentration found in samples from Lake Erie (121 ± 14 ng g-1), followed by samples from Lake Ontario (46 ± 5 ng g-1), Lake Huron (39 ± 10 ng g-1), Lake Michigan (16 ± 3 ng g-1), and Lake Superior (5 ± 1 ng g-1). Perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS) was detected in 89\% of the samples, with the highest concentration in Lake Erie samples (9.8 ± 1.6 ng g-1), and lowest concentration in samples from Lake Superior (0.7 ± 0.1 ng g-1). Statistically significant correlations were observed between PFOS and PFDS concentrations, and PFOS concentration and body weight, respectively. The PFCAs were detected in all samples, with the highest total average concentration in samples from Lake Erie (19 ng g-1), followed by samples from Lake Huron (16 ng g-1), Lake Ontario (10 ng g-1), Lake Michigan (9 ng g-1) and Lake Superior (7 ng g-1). The compounds with significant contributions to the ∑PFCA concentrations were PFOA and C9−C13−PFCAs. The 8:2 FTUCA was detected at concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 0.2 ng g-1, with the highest level in samples showing also elevated concentrations of PFOA (4.4 ng g-1 for Lake Michigan vs 1.5 ng g-1 for all other samples). The 10:2 FTUCA was detected only in 9\% of all samples (nd, 45 pg g-1). For those PFCs where we determined lake water concentrations, the highest log BAFs were calculated for PFOS (4.1), PFDA (3.9), and PFOSA (3.8).},

The decline in bee abundances is particularly alarming given their role in pollination; bee losses are a major threat to human food security and ecosystem stability. These losses are associated with intensive land use, which exposes bees to pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids. The latter may harm bees directly and/or exacerbate threats from other chemicals, imported parasites and diseases (1), or habitat loss. On page 109 of this issue, Mitchell et al. (2) show that most honeys sampled from around the world between 2012 and 2016 contain neonicotinoids at levels known to be neuroactive in bees. The work highlights the global nature of this threat to bees.

	abstract = {Pesticide mixtures are common in streams with agricultural or urban influence in the watershed. The Pesticide Toxicity Index (PTI) is a screening tool to assess potential aquatic toxicity of complex pesticide mixtures by combining measures of pesticide exposure and acute toxicity in an additive toxic-unit model. The PTI is determined separately for fish, cladocerans, and benthic invertebrates. This study expands the number of pesticides and degradates included in previous editions of the PTI from 124 to 492 pesticides and degradates, and includes two types of PTI for use in different applications, depending on study objectives. The Median-PTI was calculated from median toxicity values for individual pesticides, so is robust to outliers and is appropriate for comparing relative potential toxicity among samples, sites, or pesticides. The Sensitive-PTI uses the 5th percentile of available toxicity values, so is a more sensitive screening-level indicator of potential toxicity. PTI predictions of toxicity in environmental samples were tested using data aggregated from published field studies that measured pesticide concentrations and toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia in ambient stream water. C. dubia survival was reduced to ≤50\% of controls in 44\% of samples with Median-PTI values of 0.1–1, and to 0\% in 96\% of samples with Median-PTI values {\textgreater}1. The PTI is a relative, but quantitative, indicator of potential toxicity that can be used to evaluate relationships between pesticide exposure and biological condition.},

	abstract = {Ongoing honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony losses are of significant international concern because of the essential role these insects play in pollinating crops. Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to colony failure; however, the potential role(s) of commonly-used neonicotinoid insecticides has emerged as particularly concerning. Neonicotinoids act on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous system to eliminate pest insects. However, mounting evidence indicates that neonicotinoids also may adversely affect beneficial pollinators, such as the honey bee, via impairments on learning and memory, and ultimately foraging success. The specific mechanisms linking activation of the nAChR to adverse effects on learning and memory are uncertain. Additionally, clear connections between observed impacts on individual bees and colony level effects are lacking. The objective of this review was to develop adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) as a means to evaluate the biological plausibility and empirical evidence supporting (or refuting) the linkage between activation of the physiological target site, the nAChR, and colony level consequences. Potential for exposure was not a consideration in AOP development and therefore this effort should not be considered a risk assessment. Nonetheless, development of the AOPs described herein has led to the identification of research gaps which, for example, may be of high priority in understanding how perturbation of pathways involved in neurotransmission can adversely affect normal colony functions, causing colony instability and subsequent bee population failure. A putative AOP network was developed, laying the foundation for further insights as to the role of combined chemical and non-chemical stressors in impacting bee populations. Insights gained from the AOP network assembly, which more realistically represents multi-stressor impacts on honey bee colonies, are promising toward understanding common sensitive nodes in key biological pathways and identifying where mitigation strategies may be focused to reduce colony losses.},

The aim of this work is to edit the state of the art on few selected CECs having the potential to enter the soil and aquatic systems and cause adverse effects in humans, wildlife, and the environment: bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), benzophenones (BPs), and benzotriazole (BT). Some reviews are already available on BPA and NP, reporting about their behavior in surface water and sediments, but scarce and scattered information is available about their presence in soil and groundwater. Only a few studies are available about BPs and BT in the environment, in particular in soil and groundwater. This work summarizes the information available in the literature about the incidence and behavior of these compounds in the different environmental matrices and food. In particular, the review focuses on the physical-chemical properties, the environmental fate, the major degradation byproducts, and the environmental evidence of the selected CECs.},

	abstract = {Caffeine is the most consumed pychostimulant in the world, and it is known to affect basic and fundamental human processes such as sleep, arousal, cognition and learning and memory. It works as a nonselective blocker of adenosine receptors (A1, A2a, A2b and A3) and has been related to the regulation of heart rate, the contraction/relaxation of cardiac and smooth muscles, and the neural signaling in the central nervous system (CNS). Since the late 1990s, studies using adenosine receptor antagonists, such as Caffeine, to block the A1 and A2a adenosine receptor subtypes have shown to reduce the physical, cellular and molecular damages caused by a spinal cord injury (SCI) or a stroke (cerebral infarction) and by other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Interestingly, other studies using adenosine receptor agonists have also shown to provide a neuroprotective effect on various models of neurodegenerative diseases through the reduction of excitatory neurotransmitter release, apoptosis and inflammatory responses, among others. The seemingly paradoxical use of both adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists as neuroprotective agents has been attributed to differences in dosage levels, drug delivery method, extracellular concentration of excitatory neurotransmitters and stage of disease progression. We discuss and compare recent findings using both antagonists and agonists of adenosine receptors in animal models and patients that have suffered spinal cord injuries, brain strokes, and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Additionally, we propose alternative interpretations on the seemingly paradoxical use of these drugs as potential pharmacological tools to treat these various types of neurodegenerative diseases.},

Here we describe a multistep, performance-based validation of new methods and demonstrate that these new tools are sufficiently robust to be used in the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). Results from 18 estrogen receptor (ER) ToxCast high-throughput screening assays were integrated into a computational model that can discriminate bioactivity from assay-specific interference and cytotoxicity. Model scores range from 0 (no activity) to 1 (bioactivity of 17β-estradiol). ToxCast ER model performance was evaluated for reference chemicals, as well as results of EDSP Tier 1 screening assays in current practice. The ToxCast ER model accuracy was 86\% to 93\% when compared to reference chemicals and predicted results of EDSP Tier 1 guideline and other uterotrophic studies with 84\% to 100\% accuracy. The performance of high-throughput assays and ToxCast ER model predictions demonstrates that these methods correctly identify active and inactive reference chemicals, provide a measure of relative ER bioactivity, and rapidly identify chemicals with potential endocrine bioactivities for additional screening and testing. EPA is accepting ToxCast ER model data for 1812 chemicals as alternatives for EDSP Tier 1 ER binding, ER transactivation, and uterotrophic assays.},

The controlled, computer-readable vocabulary that defines an AOP has the ability to, automatically and on a large scale, integrate AOP knowledge with publically available sources of biological high-throughput data and its derived associations. To support the discovery and development of putative (existing) and potential AOPs, we introduce the AOP-DB, an exploratory database resource that aggregates association relationships between genes and their related chemicals, diseases, pathways, species orthology information, ontologies, and gene interactions. These associations are mined from publically available annotation databases and are integrated with the AOP information centralized in the AOP-Wiki, allowing for the automatic characterization of both putative and potential AOPs in the context of multiple areas of biological information, referred to here as “biological entities”. The AOP-DB acts as a hypothesis-generation tool for the expansion of putative AOPs, as well as the characterization of potential AOPs, through the creation of association networks across these biological entities. Finally, the AOP-DB provides a useful interface between the AOP framework and existing chemical screening and prioritization efforts by the US Environmental Protection Agency.},

Historically, in vitro assessments focused on a few biological pathways, for example, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) or estrogen receptor (ER) activities. High-throughput screening (HTS) technologies have greatly increased the number of biological targets and processes that can be rapidly assessed. Here we screened extracts of surface waters from a nationwide survey of United States streams for bioactivities associated with 69 different end points using two multiplexed HTS assays. Bioactivity of extracts from 38 streams was evaluated and compared with concentrations of over 700 analytes to identify chemicals contributing to observed effects. Eleven primary biological end points were detected. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) and AhR-mediated activities were the most commonly detected. Measured chemicals did not completely account for AhR and PXR responses. Surface waters with AhR and PXR effects were associated with low intensity, developed land cover. Likewise, elevated bioactivities frequently associated with wastewater discharges included endocrine-related end points ER and glucocorticoid receptor. These results underscore the value of bioassay-based monitoring of environmental mixtures for detecting biological effects that could not be ascertained solely through chemical analyses.},

Previous studies have identified relationships between the presence of CECs in water and broad-scale watershed characteristics. However, relationships between the presence of CECs and source-related watershed characteristics have not been explored across the Great Lakes basin. Boosted regression tree (BRT) analyses were used to develop predictive models of CEC occurrence in water and sediment throughout 24 U.S. tributaries to the Great Lakes. Models were based on the distribution of both broad-scale and source-related watershed characteristics. Twenty-one upstream watershed characteristics, including land cover, number of permitted point sources, and distance to point sources were used to develop models predicting the probability of CEC occurrence in surface water and bottom sediment. Total accuracy of BRT models ranged from 66\% to 94\% for both matrices. All 21 watershed characteristics were important predictor variables in at least one surface-water model; twenty were important in at least one bottom-sediment model. Among the model variables, developed land use and distance to point sources were important predictors of the presence of CEC classes in both water and sediment. Although limitations exist, BRT models are one tool available for assessing vulnerability of fisheries and aquatic resources to CEC occurrences.},

	abstract = {The Laurentian Great Lakes contain one fifth of the world’s surface freshwater and have been impacted by human activity since the Industrial Revolution. In addition to legacy contaminants, nitrification and invasive species, this aquatic ecosystem is also the recipient of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) with poorly understood biological consequences. In the current study, we documented the presence, concentrations, and biological effects of CECs across 27 field sites in six Great Lakes tributaries by examining over 2250 resident and caged sunfish (Lepomis ssp.) for a variety of morphological and physiological endpoints and related these results to CEC occurrence. CEC were ubiquitous across studies sites and their presence and concentrations in water and sediment were highest in effluent dominated rivers and downstream of municipal wastewater treatment plant discharges. However, even putative upstream reference sites were not free of CEC presence and fish at these sites exhibited biological effects consistent with CEC exposure. Only the Fox River exhibited consistent adverse biological effects, including increased relative liver size, greater prominence of hepatocyte vacuoles and increased plasma glucose concentrations. Canonical Redundancy Analysis revealed consistent patterns of biological consequences of CEC exposure across all six tributaries. Increasing plasma glucose concentrations, likely as a result of pollutant-induced metabolic stress, were associated with increased relative liver size and greater prominence of hepatocyte vacuoles. These indicators of pollutant exposure were inversely correlated with indicators of reproductive potential including smaller gonad size and less mature gametes. The current study highlights the need for greater integration of chemical and biological studies and suggests that CECs in the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin may adversely affect the reproductive potential of exposed fish populations.},

We conducted a basin-wide study to identify the presence of CECs and other chemicals of interest in 12 U.S. tributaries to the Laurentian Great Lakes during 2013 and 2014. A total of 292 surface-water and 80 sediment samples were collected and analyzed for approximately 200 chemicals. A total of 32 and 28 chemicals were detected in at least 30\% of water and sediment samples, respectively. Concentrations ranged from 0.0284 (indole) to 72.2 (cholesterol) μg/L in water and 1.75 (diphenhydramine) to 20,800 μg/kg (fluoranthene) in sediment. Cluster analyses revealed chemicals that frequently co-occurred such as pharmaceuticals and flame retardants at sites receiving similar inputs such as wastewater treatment plant effluent. Comparison of environmental concentrations to water and sediment-quality benchmarks revealed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations often exceeded benchmarks in both water and sediment. Additionally, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and dichlorvos concentrations exceeded water-quality benchmarks in several rivers. Results from this study can be used to understand organism exposure, prioritize river basins for future management efforts, and guide detailed assessments of factors influencing transport and fate of CECs in the Great Lakes Basin.},

These isolates were able to grow and utilize PCP as a carbon and energy source. HPLC analysis and stoichiometric release of chloride in the medium confirmed the degradation ability of these isolates. The removal efficiency of PCP by these bacterial isolates was highly significant and they were able to degrade more than 90\% of PCP when grown at high concentration of PCP (600mgl−1). Consortia of these isolates removed 77\% of PCP from the sludge. The removal efficiency of PCP by the bacterial isolate used in this study was found to be more efficient than what has been reported with other Bacillus species.

Of particular concern are endocrine-disrupting compounds, such as estrogens, which can affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis function in exposed organisms. The present study examined reproductive effects in fathead minnows exposed for 21 d to a historically estrogenic WWTP effluent. Fathead minnow breeding pairs were held in control water or 1 of 3 effluent concentrations (5\%, 20\%, and 100\%) in a novel onsite, flow-through system providing real-time exposure. The authors examined molecular and biochemical endpoints representing key events along adverse outcome pathways linking estrogen receptor activation and other molecular initiating events to reproductive impairment. In addition, the authors used chemical analysis of the effluent to construct a chemical-gene interaction network to aid in targeted gene expression analyses and identifying potentially impacted biological pathways. Cumulative fecundity was significantly reduced in fish exposed to 100\% effluent but increased in those exposed to 20\% effluent, the approximate dilution factor in the receiving waters. Plasma vitellogenin concentrations in males increased in a dose-dependent manner with effluent concentration; however, male fertility was not impacted. Although in vitro analyses, analytical chemistry, and biomarker responses confirmed the effluent was estrogenic, estrogen receptor agonists were unlikely the primary driver of impaired reproduction. The results provide insights into the significance of pathway-based effects with regard to predicting adverse reproductive outcomes. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:702–716.

	abstract = {Ill-defined, multi-component mixtures of steroidal pharmaceuticals are present in the aquatic environment. Fish are extremely sensitive to some of these steroids. It is important to know how fish respond to these mixtures, and from that knowledge develop methodology that enables accurate prediction of those responses. To provide some of the data required to reach this objective, pairs of fish were first exposed to five different synthetic steroidal pharmaceuticals (one estrogen, EE2; one androgen, trenbolone; one glucocorticoid, beclomethasone dipropionate; and two progestogens, desogestrel and levonorgestrel) and concentration-response data on egg production obtained. Based on those concentration-response relationships, a five component mixture was designed and tested twice. Very similar effects were observed in the two experiments. The mixture inhibited egg production in an additive manner predicted better by the model of Independent Action than that of Concentration Addition. Our data provide a reference case for independent action in an in vivo model. A significant combined effect was observed when each steroidal pharmaceutical in the mixture was present at a concentration which on its own would produce no statistically significant effect (something from ‘nothing’). Further, when each component was present in the mixture at a concentration expected to inhibit egg production by between 18\% (Beclomethasone diproprionate) and 40\% (trenbolone), this mixture almost completely inhibited egg production: a phenomenon we term ‘a lot from a little’. The results from this proof-of-principle study suggest that multiple steroids present in the aquatic environment can be analysed for their potential combined environmental risk.},

	abstract = {The US Environmental Protection Agency has responsibility for assessing endocrine activity of more than 10 000 chemicals, a task that cannot reasonably be achieved solely through use of available mammalian and nonmammalian in vivo screening assays. Hence, it has been proposed that chemicals be prioritized for in vivo testing using data from in vitro high-throughput assays for specific endocrine system targets. Recent efforts focused on potential estrogenic chemicals—specifically those that activate estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα)—have broadly demonstrated feasibility of the approach. However, a major uncertainty is whether prioritization based on mammalian (primarily human) high-throughput assays accurately reflects potential chemical–ERα interactions in nonmammalian species. The authors conducted a comprehensive analysis of cross-species comparability of chemical–ERα interactions based on information concerning structural attributes of estrogen receptors, in vitro binding and transactivation data for ERα, and the effects of a range of chemicals on estrogen-signaling pathways in vivo. Overall, this integrated analysis suggests that chemicals with moderate to high estrogenic potency in mammalian systems also should be priority chemicals in nonmammalian vertebrates. However, the degree to which the prioritization approach might be applicable to invertebrates is uncertain because of a lack of knowledge of the biological role(s) of possible ERα orthologs found in phyla such as annelids. Further, comparative analysis of in vitro data for fish and reptiles suggests that mammalian-based assays may not effectively capture ERα interactions for low-affinity chemicals in all vertebrate classes.

	abstract = {Several OCs have been detected in bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nestling (eaglet) plasma in the upper Midwestern United States. Despite frequent and relatively high concentrations of OCs in eaglets, little is understood about potential biological effects associated with exposure. We screened an existing database of OC concentrations in eaglet plasma collected from the Midwestern United States against bioactivity information from the ToxCast database. ToxCast bioactivity information consists of concentrations expected to elicit responses across a range of biological space (e.g. cellular, developmental, etc.) obtained from a series of high throughput assays. We calculated exposure—activity ratios (EAR) by calculating the ratio of plasma concentrations to concentrations available in ToxCast. Bioactivity data were not available for all detected OCs. Therefore, our analysis provides estimates of potential bioactivity for 19 of the detected OCs in eaglet plasma. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) EAR values were consistently the highest among all study areas. Maximum EAR values were ≥1 for PFOS, perfluorononanoic acid, and bisphenol A in 99.7, 0.53 and 0.26\% of samples, indicating that some plasma concentrations were greater than what may be expected to elicit biological responses. About 125 gene targets, indicative of specific biological pathways, were identified as potentially being affected. Inhibition of several CYP genes, involved in xenobiotic metabolism, were most consistently identified. Other identified biological responses have potential implications for motor coordination, cardiac functions, behavior, and blood circulation. However, it is unclear what these results mean for bald eagles, given that ToxCast data are generated using mammalian-based endpoints. Despite uncertainties and limitations, this method of screening environmental data can be useful for informing future monitoring or research focused on understanding the occurrence and effects of OCs in bald eagles and other similarly-positioned trophic species.},

	abstract = {Legislation and prospective legislative proposals internationally (may) require that chemicals be tested for their ability to disrupt the hormonal systems of mammals. Chemicals found to test positive in vitro are considered to be endocrine active substances (EAS) and may be putative endocrine disruptors (EDs) in vivo. While there is a growing body of international in vitro test guidelines addressing EAS mechanisms and modes of action, to date there are still few or no standardized methods to incorporate metabolic and toxicokinetic aspects into these in vitro tests for EAS. In vitro assays for EAS should incorporate metabolic enzyme systems to better address the relevance of EAS tests to in vivo adverse outcome pathways, and a previous OECD review paper indicated how this could be done. This paper revisits those recommendations, addressing where research and funding efforts are needed to expedite the development of suitable in vitro metabolism systems to improve the accuracy of in vitro assays for identifying EAS and EDs. Recommendations are made for projects to support short, medium, and long-term goals. The complexity of in vivo metabolism presents major challenges for the development of predictive models suitable for the extrapolation of data from in silico/in vitro approaches to models that can occur in vivo. Therefore, the long-term recommendations are intended to foster an international harmonization of databases, delineation of metabolic pathways, and development of predictive tools that will provide a fundamental understanding of the processes by which metabolism occurs, increasing the predictive accuracy of in silico/in vitro methods.},

	abstract = {The US EPA's ToxCast program is designed to assess chemical perturbations of molecular and cellular endpoints using a variety of high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. However, existing HTS assays have limited or no xenobiotic metabolism which could lead to false positive (chemical is detoxified in vivo) as well as false negative results (chemical is bioactivated in vivo) and thus potential mischaracterization of chemical hazard. To address this challenge, the ten most prevalent human liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes were introduced into a human cell line (HEK293T) with low endogenous metabolic capacity. The CYP enzymes were introduced via transfection of modified mRNAs as either singlets or as a mixture in relative proportions as expressed in human liver. Initial experiments using luminogenic substrates demonstrate that CYP enzyme activities are significantly increased when co-transfected with an mRNA encoding a CYP accessory protein, P450 oxidoreductase (POR). Transfected HEK293T cells demonstrate the ability to produce predicted metabolites following treatment with well-studied CYP substrates for at least 18 h post-treatment. As a demonstration of how this method can be used to retrofit existing HTS assays, a proof-of-concept screen for cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells was conducted using 56 test compounds. The results demonstrate that the xenobiotic metabolism conferred by transfection of CYP-encoding mRNAs shifts the dose-response relationship for some of the tested chemicals such as aflatoxin B1 (bioactivation) and fenazaquin (detoxification). Overall, transfection of CYP-encoding mRNAs is an effective and portable solution for retrofitting existing cell-based HTS assays with metabolic competence.},

	abstract = {Assessing the biological activity of compounds is an essential objective of biomedical research. We show that one can infer the bioactivity of compounds by assessing the activity of transcription factors (TFs) that regulate gene expression. Using a multiplex reporter system, the FACTORIAL, we characterized cell response to a compound by a quantitative signature, the TF activity profile (TFAP). We found that perturbagens of biological pathways elicited distinct TFAP signatures in human cells. Unexpectedly, perturbagens of the same pathway all produced identical TFAPs, regardless of where or how they interfered. We found invariant TFAPs for mitochondrial, histone deacetylase, and ubiquitin/proteasome pathway inhibitors; cytoskeleton disruptors; and DNA-damaging agents. Using these invariant signatures permitted straightforward identification of compounds with specified bioactivities among uncharacterized chemicals. Furthermore, this approach allowed us to assess the multiple bioactivities of polypharmacological drugs. Thus, TF activity profiling affords straightforward assessment of the bioactivity of compounds through the identification of perturbed biological pathways.
Transcription factor activity profiling reveals invariant signatures of perturbed biological pathways and cell systems.

	abstract = {Oxidative metabolism of the insect repellentN,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) by pooled human liver microsomes (HLM), rat liver microsomes (RLM), and mouse liver microsomes (MLM) was investigated. DEET is metabolized by cytochromes P450 (P450s) leading to the production of a ring methyl oxidation product,N,N-diethyl-m-hydroxymethylbenzamide (BALC), and an N-deethylated product,N-ethyl-m-toluamide (ET). Both the affinities and intrinsic clearance of HLM for ring hydroxylation are greater than those for N-deethylation. Pooled HLM show significantly lower affinities (Km) than RLM for metabolism of DEET to either of the primary metabolites (BALC and ET). Among 15 cDNA-expressed P450 enzymes examined, CYP1A2, 2B6, 2D6*1 (Val374), and 2E1 metabolized DEET to the BALC metabolite, whereas CYP3A4, 3A5, 2A6, and 2C19 produced the ET metabolite. CYP2B6 is the principal cytochrome P450 involved in the metabolism of DEET to its major BALC metabolite, whereas CYP2C19 had the greatest activity for the formation of the ET metabolite. Use of phenotyped HLMs demonstrated that individuals with high levels of CYP2B6, 3A4, 2C19, and 2A6 have the greatest potential to metabolize DEET. Mice treated with DEET demonstrated induced levels of the CYP2B family, increased hydroxylation, and a 2.4-fold increase in the metabolism of chlorpyrifos to chlorpyrifos-oxon, a potent anticholinesterase. Preincubation of human CYP2B6 with chlorpyrifos completely inhibited the metabolism of DEET. Preincubation of human or rodent microsomes with chlorpyrifos, permethrin, and pyridostigmine bromide alone or in combination can lead to either stimulation or inhibition of DEET metabolism.},

The goal of this study was to assess hepatic levels of vitellogenin (Vtg), zona radiata proteins (Zrp) and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II), and relating them to reproductive endpoints in a wild fish population habiting a reservoir that receive domestic sewage, agricultural and industrial residues. Adult fish Astyanax fasciatus were sampled during the reproductive season in five sites from the Furnas Reservoir, Grande River, and Paraguay–Paraná basin. As a control to field data, fish were experimentally exposed via dietary intake, to oestradiol benzoate (OB) for 7 days. Fish from site with little anthropogenic interference showed hepatic levels of Vtg, Zrp and IGF-I and IGF-II similar to those from the non-treated experimental group. In sites located immediately downstream from the municipal wastewater discharges, the water total oestrogen was {\textgreater}120ng/l, and male fish displayed increased Vtg and Zrp and decreased IGF-I levels similar to OB treated fish. In females, levels of Vtg, Zrp, IGF-I and IGF-II suggest an impairment of final oocyte maturation and spawning, as also detected by frequency of over-ripening, follicular atresia and fecundity. At the sites that receive agricultural and industrial residues, the water total oestrogen was {\textless}50ng/l and females showed decreased Zrp and increased IGF-II levels associated to reduced diameter of vitellogenic follicles, indicating an inhibition of oocyte growth. Overall, the current study reports oestrogenic contamination impairing the reproduction of a wild fish from a hydroeletric reservoir and, the data contribute to improving the current knowledge on relationship between hepatic Vtg, Zrp and IGF-I and IGF-II, and reproductive endpoints in a teleost fish. In addition, our data point out novel reproductive biomarkers (IGF-I, IGF-II and over-ripening) to assessing xenoestrogenic contamination in freshwater ecosystems.},

Studies were conducted to document biomarker responses both temporally and spatially to better understand the influence of normal physiological cycles, as well as water quality and land-use influences. Smallmouth bass were collected over a 2-year period from three tributaries of the Potomac River: the Shenandoah River, the South Branch Potomac and Conococheague Creek, and an out-of-basin reference site on the Gauley River. The prevalence of TO varied seasonally with the lowest prevalence observed in July, post-spawn. Reproductive maturity and/or lack of spawning the previous spring, as well as land-use practices such as application of manure and pesticides, may influence the seasonal observations. Annual, seasonal, and site differences were also observed in the percentage of males with measurable concentrations of plasma vitellogenin, mean concentration of plasma vitellogenin in females, and plasma concentrations of 17β-estradiol and testosterone in both sexes. Bass collected in the South Branch Potomac (moderate to high prevalence of TO) had less sperm per testes mass with a lower percentage of those sperm being motile when compared to those from the Gauley River (low prevalence of TO). An inverse relationship was noted between TO severity and sperm motility. An association between TO severity and wastewater treatment plant flow, percent of agriculture, total number of animal feeding operations, the number of poultry houses, and animal density within the catchment was observed.},

A data matrix of 559 water samples was queried to identify two commonly occurring CECs mixtures in Great Lakes tributaries. One mixture consisted of eight agricultural CECs (AG), while another contained 11 urban CECs (UB). The known estrogenic compounds bisphenol A, estrone and nonylphenol were present in both mixtures. According to the EPA Tox21 in ToxCast database, AG and UB mixture at an environmentally relevant concentration were estimated to account for 6.5\% and 3.4\% estrogenicity of the model endocrine disruptor estradiol-17β, respectively. Two isoforms of the estrogen receptor (Esr1 and -2, former Erα and Erβ) cloned from fathead minnow, bluegill sunfish, American alligator and human, responded differently to AG and UB mixtures. Human and bluegill Esr1 were the most sensitive to AG and UB mixtures, respectively. Fathead minnow Esr1 and Esr2b were the least sensitive to 10× AG and UB in estrogen dose equivalents, respectively. Even at environmentally documented concentrations, UB significantly activated bluegill Esr1. Moreover, 100× concentrated UB hyperstimulated fathead minnow Esr1 beyond the maximum induction of estradiol-17β. These results indicate that efficacious receptors and species differ in their response to CEC mixtures. Furthermore, estrogenicity may be present in some CECs not previously considered estrogenic, or, alternatively, estrogenicity of a mixture may be enhanced through chemical interactions. Our study highlights the need for further studies of CECs utilizing a variety of receptors cloned from diverse species.},

	abstract = {The Laurentian Great Lakes are a valuable natural resource that is affected by contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including sex steroid hormones, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and new generation pesticides. However, little is known about the fate and biological effects of CECs in tributaries to the Great Lakes. In the current study, 16 sites on three rivers in the Great Lakes basin (Fox, Cuyahoga, and Raquette Rivers) were assessed for CEC presence using polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) and grab water samplers. Biological activity was assessed through a combination of in vitro bioassays (focused on estrogenic activity) and in vivo assays with larval fathead minnows. In addition, resident sunﬁsh, largemouth bass, and white suckers were assessed for changes in biological endpoints associated with CEC exposure. CECs were present in all water samples and POCIS extracts. A total of 111 and 97 chemicals were detected in at least one water sample and POCIS extract, respectively. Known estrogenic chemicals were detected in water samples at all 16 sites and in POCIS extracts at 13 sites. Most sites elicited estrogenic activity in bioassays. Ranking sites and rivers based on water chemistry, POCIS chemistry, or total in vitro estrogenicity produced comparable patterns with the Cuyahoga River ranking as most and the Raquette River as least affected by CECs. Changes in biological responses grouped according to physiological processes, and differed between species but not sex. The Fox and Cuyahoga Rivers often had signiﬁcantly different patterns in biological response Our study supports the need for multiple lines of evidence and provides a framework to assess CEC presence and effects in ﬁsh in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin.},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) derived from fossil fuels are ubiquitous contaminants and occur in aquatic habitats as highly variable and complex mixtures of compounds containing 2 to 6 rings. For aquatic species, PAHs are generally accepted as acting through either of two modes of action: (1) “dioxin-like” toxicity mediated by activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which controls a battery of genes involved in PAH metabolism, such as cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) and (2) “nonpolar narcosis”, in which tissue uptake is dependent solely on hydrophobicity and toxicity is mediated through non-specific partitioning into lipid bilayers. As part of a systematic analysis of mechanisms of PAH developmental toxicity in zebrafish, we show here that three tetracyclic PAHs (pyrene, chrysene, and benz[a]anthracene) activate the AHR pathway tissue-specifically to induce distinct patterns of CYP1A expression. Using morpholino knockdown of ahr1a, ahr2, and cyp1a, we show that distinct embryolarval syndromes induced by exposure to two of these compounds are differentially dependent on tissue-specific activation of AHR isoforms or metabolism by CYP1A. Exposure of embryos with and without circulation (silent heart morphants) resulted in dramatically different patterns of CYP1A induction, with circulation required to deliver some compounds to internal tissues. Therefore, biological effects of PAHs cannot be predicted simply by quantitative measures of AHR activity or a compound's hydrophobicity. These results indicate that current models of PAH toxicity in fish are greatly oversimplified and that individual PAHs are pharmacologically active compounds with distinct and specific cellular targets.},

	abstract = {A model based on partition coefficient was developed for predicting subchronic toxicities of selected chemicals to fish. Early life stage tests were conducted under flow-through conditions using fathead minnows (Pirnephules promelus) as test organisms. Embryos, larvae and juveniles were continuously exposed to chemicals for a total of 31 to 33 d. Test endpoints included egg hatchability, incidence of developmental abnormalities, survival and growth. The “chronic value” for each test was a point estimate of the maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC), and was determined as the geometric mean of the highest test concentration producing no effect and the lowest concentration significantly ( p 5 0.05) affecting one or more endpoints. Ten industrial organic compounds from four chemical classes (ketones, benzenes, ethers and alkyl halides) were used in model development. All chemicals were considered to induce narcosis in fish in acute toxicity tests. The relationship between estimated MATC n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log P)was expressed by the equation: log estimated MATC (mol L-’) = -0.886 log P - 2.18 ( r 2= 0.925). This model was used to predict subchronic toxicities for eight other alkyl halides and chlorinated benzenes that had been tested with fathead minnows and reported in the literature. The mean ratio for observed chronic toxicity value to predicted chronic toxicity value was 2.00 t 2.03. Observed values ranged from 0.29 to 6.02 times the predicted values. For the 10 chemicals used in the model, the mean acute/chronic toxicity ratio (96-h LCSO/chronic value) was 12.2 f 8.5.},

	abstract = {Triphenyl phosphate (TPP), one of the most widely used organophosphate ﬂame retardants (OPFRs), has frequently been detected in the environment and biota. However, knowledge of its toxicological effects is limited. The present study was conducted to determine the adverse effects of TPP on the thyroid endocrine system of embryonic/larval zebraﬁsh, and the underlying mechanisms for these effects were studied using rat pituitary (GH3) and thyroid follicular (FRTL-5) cell lines. In the GH3 cells, TPP up-regulated the expression of the tshˇ, tr˛, and trˇ genes, while T3, a positive control, down-regulated the expression of these genes. In the FRTL-5 cells, the expression of the nis and tpo genes was signiﬁcantly up-regulated, suggesting that TPP stimulates thyroid hormone synthesis in the thyroid gland. In zebraﬁsh larvae at 7 days post-fertilization (dpf), TPP exposure led to signiﬁcant increases in both T3 and T4 concentrations and expression of the genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis. Exposure to TPP also signiﬁcantly upregulated the expression of the genes related to the metabolism (dio1), transport (ttr), and elimination (ugt1ab) of thyroid hormones. The down-regulation of the crh and tshˇ genes in the zebraﬁsh larvae suggests the activation of a central regulatory feedback mechanism induced by the increased T3 levels in vivo. Taken together, our observations show that TPP could increase the thyroid hormone concentrations in the early life stages of zebraﬁsh by disrupting the central regulation and hormone synthesis pathways.},

The goal of this research was to evaluate the sublethal responses in Corbicula ﬂuminea such as, general stress (lysosomal membrane stability [LMS]), biomarkers of phase I and II (etoxyresoruﬁn O-deethylase [EROD], dibenzylﬂuorescein dealkylase [DBF], gluthathione-S-transferase [GST]), oxidative stress (gluthathione reductase [GR], gluthathione peroxidase [GPX], lipid peroxidation [LPO]), and biomarkers of effect (DNA damage) after 21 days of exposure to caffeine, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, novobiocin and tamoxifen at 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 15, 50 mg LÀ1. Environmental concentrations tested in this study caused general stress and produced changes on biomarkers tested. LMS, responses from phase I and II enzymatic activity, oxidative stress, and biomarker of effect represent important ecotoxicological information, and will provide a useful reference for the assessment of selected drugs and the effects which these compounds may have on aquatic invertebrates, using C. ﬂuminea as a bioindicator species.},

	abstract = {A portion of all herbicides applied to forests, croplands, road sides, and gardens are inevitably lost to water bodies either directly through runoff or indirectly by leaching through groundwater into ephemeral streams and lakes. Once in the aquatic environment, herbicides may cause stress within aquatic communities and radically alter community structure. Atrazine is one of the most effective and inexpensive herbicides in the world and is consequently used more frequently than any other herbicide. Atrazine is frequently detected in aquatic waters, and has been known to affect reproduction of aquatic flora and fauna, which in turn impacts on the community structure as a whole. This paper presents a summary of the reported direct and indirect impacts of atrazine on aquatic organisms and community structure. The information can be used for developing improved management guidelines and legislation. It is concluded that a single universal maximum limit on the atrazine application in catchments, as suggested by many regulatory authorities, does not provide adequate protection of the aquatic environment. Rather, it is advocated that flexible limits on the application of atrazine be developed in line with the potential risk of contamination to surface and subsurface water and fragility of the aquatic environment.

	abstract = {In this study, the environmental impacts of large scale bioenergy crops were evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Daily pesticide concentration data for a study area consisting of four large watersheds located in Michigan (totaling 53,358 km2) was estimated over a six year period (2000–2005). Model outputs for atrazine, bromoxynil, glyphosate, metolachlor, pendimethalin, sethoxydim, triﬂualin, and 2,4-D model output were used to predict the possible long-term implications that large-scale bioenergy crop expansion may have on the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and humans. Threshold toxicity levels were obtained for the bluegill and for human consumption for all pesticides being evaluated through an extensive literature review. Model output was compared to each toxicity level for the suggested exposure time (96-hour for bluegill and 24-hour for humans). The results suggest that traditional intensive row crops such as canola, corn and sorghum may negatively impact aquatic life, and in most cases affect the safe drinking water availability. The continuous corn rotation, the most representative rotation for current agricultural practices for a starch-based ethanol economy, delivers the highest concentrations of glyphosate to the stream. In addition, continuous canola contributed to a concentration of 1.11 ppm of triﬂuralin, a highly toxic herbicide, which is 8.7 times the 96-hour ecotoxicity of bluegills and 21 times the safe drinking water level. Also during the period of study, continuous corn resulted in the impairment of 541,152 km of stream. However, there is promise with second-generation lignocellulosic bioenergy crops such as switchgrass, which resulted in a 171,667 km reduction in total stream length that exceeds the human threshold criteria, as compared to the base scenario. Results of this study may be useful in determining the suitability of bioenergy crop rotations and aid in decision making regarding the adaption of large-scale bioenergy cropping systems.},

	abstract = {The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework is increasingly used to integrate data based on traditional and emerging toxicity testing paradigms. As the number of AOP descriptions has increased, so has the need to define the AOP in computable terms. Herein, we present a comprehensive annotation of 172 AOPs housed in the AOP-Wiki as of December 4, 2016, using terms from existing biological ontologies. AOP Key Events (KEs) were assigned ontology terms using a concept called the Event Component, which consists of a Process, an Object, and an Action term, with each term originating from ontologies and other controlled vocabularies. Annotation of KEs with ontology classes from 14 ontologies and controlled vocabularies resulted in a total of 685 KEs being annotated with a total of 809 Event Components. A set of seven conventions resulted, defining the annotation of KEs via Event Components. This expanded annotation of AOPs allows computational reasoners to aid in both AOP development and applications. In addition, the incorporation of explicit biological objects will reduce the time required for converting a qualitative AOP description into a conceptual model that can support computational modeling. As high-throughput genomics becomes a more important part of the high-throughput toxicity testing landscape, the new approaches described here for annotating KEs will also promote the visualization and analysis of genomics data in an AOP context.},

	abstract = {With the release of the landmark report Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, in 2007, precipitated a major change in the way toxicity testing is conducted. It envisions increased efficiency in toxicity testing and decreased animal usage by transitioning from current expensive and lengthy in vivo testing with qualitative endpoints to in vitro toxicity pathway assays on human cells or cell lines using robotic high-throughput screening with mechanistic quantitative parameters. Risk assessment in the exposed human population would focus on avoiding significant perturbations in these toxicity pathways. Computational systems biology models would be implemented to determine the dose-response models of perturbations of pathway function. Extrapolation of in vitro results to in vivo human blood and tissue concentrations would be based on pharmacokinetic models for the given exposure condition. This practice would enhance human relevance of test results, and would cover several test agents, compared to traditional toxicological testing strategies. As all the tools that are necessary to implement the vision are currently available or in an advanced stage of development, the key prerequisites to achieving this paradigm shift are a commitment to change in the scientific community, which could be facilitated by a broad discussion of the vision, and obtaining necessary resources to enhance current knowledge of pathway perturbations and pathway assays in humans and to implement computational systems biology models. Implementation of these strategies would result in a new toxicity testing paradigm firmly based on human biology.},

We previously piloted the concept of a Connectivity Map (CMap), whereby genes, drugs, and disease states are connected by virtue of common gene-expression signatures. Here, we report more than a 1,000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS Consortium, made possible by a new, low-cost, high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to RNA sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81\% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million L1000 profiles described here, as well as tools for their analysis, are available at https://clue.io.},

	abstract = {Background: In 2008, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences/National Toxicology Program, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Center for Computational Toxicology, and the National Human Genome Research Institute/National Institutes of Health Chemical Genomics Center entered into an agreement on “high throughput screening, toxicity pathway profiling, and biological interpretation of findings.” In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) joined the collaboration, known informally as Tox21.
Objectives: The Tox21 partners agreed to develop a vision and devise an implementation strategy to shift the assessment of chemical hazards away from traditional experimental animal toxicology studies to one based on target-specific, mechanism-based, biological observations largely obtained using in vitro assays. Discussion: Here we outline the efforts of the Tox21 partners up to the time the FDA joined the collaboration, describe the approaches taken to develop the science and technologies that are currently being used, assess the current status, and identify problems that could impede further progress as well as suggest approaches to address those problems.
Conclusion: Tox21 faces some very difficult issues. However, we are making progress in integrating data from diverse technologies and end points into what is effectively a systems-biology approach to toxicology. This can be accomplished only when comprehensive knowledge is obtained with broad coverage of chemical and biological/toxicological space. The efforts thus far reflect the initial stage of an exceedingly complicated program, one that will likely take decades to fully achieve its goals. However, even at this stage, the information obtained has attracted the attention of the international scientific community, and we believe these efforts foretell the future of toxicology.},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) derived from fossil fuels are ubiquitous contaminants and occur in aquatic habitats as highly variable and complex mixtures of compounds containing 2 to 6 rings. For aquatic species, PAHs are generally accepted as acting through either of two modes of action: (1) “dioxin-like” toxicity mediated by activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which controls a battery of genes involved in PAH metabolism, such as cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) and (2) “nonpolar narcosis”, in which tissue uptake is dependent solely on hydrophobicity and toxicity is mediated through non-specific partitioning into lipid bilayers. As part of a systematic analysis of mechanisms of PAH developmental toxicity in zebrafish, we show here that three tetracyclic PAHs (pyrene, chrysene, and benz[a]anthracene) activate the AHR pathway tissue-specifically to induce distinct patterns of CYP1A expression. Using morpholino knockdown of ahr1a, ahr2, and cyp1a, we show that distinct embryolarval syndromes induced by exposure to two of these compounds are differentially dependent on tissue-specific activation of AHR isoforms or metabolism by CYP1A. Exposure of embryos with and without circulation (silent heart morphants) resulted in dramatically different patterns of CYP1A induction, with circulation required to deliver some compounds to internal tissues. Therefore, biological effects of PAHs cannot be predicted simply by quantitative measures of AHR activity or a compound's hydrophobicity. These results indicate that current models of PAH toxicity in fish are greatly oversimplified and that individual PAHs are pharmacologically active compounds with distinct and specific cellular targets.},

	abstract = {Chemical monitoring data were collected in surface waters from 57 Great Lakes tributaries from 2010 to 13 to identify chemicals of potential biological relevance and sites at which these chemicals occur. Traditional water-quality benchmarks for aquatic life based on in vivo toxicity data were available for 34 of 67 evaluated chemicals. To expand evaluation of potential biological effects, measured chemical concentrations were compared to chemical-specific biological activities determined in high-throughput (ToxCast) in vitro assays. Resulting exposure-activity ratios (EARs) were used to prioritize the chemicals of greatest potential concern: 4‑nonylphenol, bisphenol A, metolachlor, atrazine, DEET, caffeine, tris(2‑butoxyethyl) phosphate, tributyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, benzo(a)pyrene, fluoranthene, and benzophenone. Water-quality benchmarks were unavailable for five of these chemicals, but for the remaining seven, EAR-based prioritization was consistent with that based on toxicity quotients calculated from benchmarks. Water-quality benchmarks identified three additional PAHs (anthracene, phenanthrene, and pyrene) not prioritized using EARs. Through this analysis, an EAR of 10−3 was identified as a reasonable threshold above which a chemical might be of potential concern. To better understand apical hazards potentially associated with biological activities captured in ToxCast assays, in vitro bioactivity data were matched with available adverse outcome pathway (AOP) information. The 49 ToxCast assays prioritized via EAR analysis aligned with 23 potentially-relevant AOPs present in the AOP-Wiki. Mixture effects at monitored sites were estimated by summation of EAR values for multiple chemicals by individual assay or individual AOP. Commonly predicted adverse outcomes included impacts on reproduction and mitochondrial function. The EAR approach provided a screening-level assessment for evidence-based prioritization of chemicals and sites with potential for adverse biological effects. The approach aids prioritization of future monitoring activities and provides testable hypotheses to help focus those efforts. This also expands the fraction of detected chemicals for which biologically-based benchmark concentrations are available to help contextualize chemical monitoring results.},

	abstract = {Organic chemicals from industrial, agricultural, and residential activities can enter surface waters through regulated and unregulated discharges, combined sewer overflows, stormwater runoff, accidental spills, and leaking septic-conveyance systems on a daily basis. The impact of point and nonpoint contaminant sources can result in adverse biological effects for organisms living in or near surface waters. Assessing the adverse or toxic effects that may result when exposure occurs is complicated by the fact that many commonly used chemicals lack toxicity information or water quality standards. To address these challenges, an exposure-activity ratio (EAR) screening approach was used to prioritize environmental chemistry data in a West Virginia watershed (Wolf Creek). Wolf Creek is a drinking water source and recreation resource with documented water quality impacts from point and nonpoint sources. The EAR screening approach uses high-throughput screening (HTS) data from ToxCast as a method of integrating environmental chemical occurrence and biological effects data. Using water quality schedule 4433, which targets 69 organic waste compounds typically found in domestic and industrial wastewater, chemicals were screened for potential adverse biological affects at multiple sites in the Wolf Creek watershed. Cumulative EAR mixture values were greatest at Sites 2 and 3, where bisphenol A (BPA) and pentachlorophenol exhibited maximum EAR values of 0.05 and 0.002, respectively. Site 2 is downstream of an unconventional oil and gas (UOG) wastewater disposal facility with documented water quality impacts. Low-level organic contaminants were found at all sample sites in Wolf Creek, except Site 10, where Wolf Creek enters the New River. The application of an EAR screening approach allowed our study to extend beyond traditional environmental monitoring methods to identify multiple sites and chemicals that warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {Complex chemical mixtures have been widely reported in larger streams but relatively little work has been done to characterize them and assess their potential effects in headwater streams. In 2014, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) sampled 54 Piedmont streams over ten weeks and measured 475 unique organic compounds using five analytical methods. Maximum and median exposure conditions were evaluated in relation to watershed characteristics and for potential biological effects using multiple lines of evidence. Results demonstrate that mixed-contaminant exposures are ubiquitous and varied in sampled headwater streams. Approximately 56\% (264) of the 475 compounds were detected at least once across all sites. Cumulative maximum concentrations ranged 1,922–162,346ngL−1 per site. Chemical occurrence significantly correlated to urban land use but was not related to presence/absence of wastewater treatment facility discharges. Designed bioactive chemicals represent about 2/3rd of chemicals detected, notably pharmaceuticals and pesticides, qualitative evidence for possible adverse biological effects. Comparative Toxicogenomics Database chemical-gene associations applied to maximum exposure conditions indicate {\textgreater}12,000 and 2,900 potential gene targets were predicted at least once across all sites for fish and invertebrates, respectively. Analysis of cumulative exposure-activity ratios provided additional evidence that, at a minimum, transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to vertebrates were common. Finally, cumulative detections and concentrations correlated inversely with invertebrate metrics from in-stream surveys. The results demonstrate widespread instream exposure to extensive contaminant mixtures and compelling multiple lines of evidence for adverse effects on aquatic communities.},

	abstract = {Safe drinking water at the point-of-use (tapwater, TW) is a United States public health priority. Multiple lines of evidence were used to evaluate potential human health concerns of 482 organics and 19 inorganics in TW from 13 (7 public supply, 6 private well self-supply) home and 12 (public supply) workplace locations in 11 states. Only uranium (61.9 μg L–1, private well) exceeded a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation maximum contaminant level (MCL: 30 μg L–1). Lead was detected in 23 samples (MCL goal: zero). Seventy-five organics were detected at least once, with median detections of 5 and 17 compounds in self-supply and public supply samples, respectively (corresponding maxima: 12 and 29). Disinfection byproducts predominated in public supply samples, comprising 21\% of all detected and 6 of the 10 most frequently detected. Chemicals designed to be bioactive (26 pesticides, 10 pharmaceuticals) comprised 48\% of detected organics. Site-specific cumulative exposure–activity ratios (∑EAR) were calculated for the 36 detected organics with ToxCast data. Because these detections are fractional indicators of a largely uncharacterized contaminant space, ∑EAR in excess of 0.001 and 0.01 in 74 and 26\% of public supply samples, respectively, provide an argument for prioritized assessment of cumulative effects to vulnerable populations from trace-level TW exposures.},
