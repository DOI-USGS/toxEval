	abstract = {Safe drinking water at the point of use (tapwater, TW) is a public-health priority. TW exposures and potential human-health concerns of 540 organics and 35 inorganics were assessed in 45 Chicago-area United States (US) homes in 2017. No US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforceable Maximum Contaminant Level(s) (MCL) were exceeded in any residential or water treatment plant (WTP) pre-distribution TW sample. Ninety percent (90\%) of organic analytes were not detected in treated TW, emphasizing the high quality of the Lake Michigan drinking-water source and the efficacy of the drinking-water treatment and monitoring. Sixteen (16) organics were detected in {\textgreater}25\% of TW samples, with about 50 detected at least once. Low-level TW exposures to unregulated disinfection byproducts (DBP) of emerging concern, per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and three pesticides were ubiquitous. Common exceedances of non-enforceable EPA MCL Goal(s) (MCLG) of zero for arsenic [As], lead [Pb], uranium [U], bromodichloromethane, and tribromomethane suggest potential human-health concerns and emphasize the continuing need for improved understanding of cumulative effects of low-concentration mixtures on vulnerable sub-populations. Because DBP dominated TW organics, residential-TW concentrations are potentially predictable with expanded pre-distribution DBP monitoring. However, several TW chemicals, notably Pb and several infrequently detected organic compounds, were not readily explained by pre-distribution samples, illustrating the need for continued broad inorganic/organic TW characterization to support consumer assessment of acceptable risk and point-of-use treatment options.},

	abstract = {This research aimed to further our understanding of how environmental processes control micropollutant dynamics in surface water systems as a means to predict peak concentration events and inform intermittent sampling strategies. We characterized micropollutant concentrations in daily composite samples from the Fall Creek Monitoring Station over 18 months. These data were compiled alongside environmental covariates, including daily measurements of weather, hydrology, and water quality parameters, to generate a novel data set with high temporal resolution. We evaluated the temporal trends of several representative micropollutants, along with cumulative metrics of overall micropollutant contamination, by means of multivariable analyses to determine which combination of covariates best predicts micropollutant dynamics and peak events. Peak events of agriculture-derived micropollutants were best predicted by positive associations with turbidity and UV254 absorbance and negative associations with baseflow index. Peak events of wastewater-derived micropollutants were best predicted by positive associations with alkalinity and negative associations with streamflow rate. We demonstrate that these predictors can be used to inform intermittent sampling strategies aimed at capturing peak events, and we generalize the approach so that it could be applied in other watersheds. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to contextualize micropollutant data derived from infrequent grab samples.},

	abstract = {Sediments play an essential role in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems but simultaneously retain harmful compounds. However, sediment quality assessment methods that consider the risks caused by the combined action of all sediment-associated contaminants to benthic biota are still underrepresented in water quality assessment strategies. Significant advancements have been made in the application of effect-based methods, but methodological improvements can still advance sediment risk assessment. The present study aimed to explore such improvements by integrating effect-monitoring and chemical profiling of sediment contamination. To this end, 28 day life cycle bioassays with Chironomus riparius using intact whole sediment cores from contaminated sites were performed in tandem with explorative chemical profiling of bioavailable concentrations of groups of legacy and emerging sediment contaminants to investigate ecotoxicological risks to benthic biota. All contaminated sediments caused effects on the resilient midge C. riparius, stressing that sediment contamination is ubiquitous and potentially harmful to aquatic ecosystems. However, bioassay responses were not in line with any of the calculated toxicity indices, suggesting that toxicity was caused by unmeasured compounds. Hence, this study underlines the relevance of effect-based sediment quality assessment and provides smarter ways to do so.},

	abstract = {Globally, protected areas offer refugia for a broad range of taxa including threatened and endangered species. In the United States (US), the National Park Service (NPS) manages public lands to preserve biodiversity, but increasing park visitation and development of surrounding landscapes increase exposure to and effects from bioactive contaminants. The risk (exposure and hazard) to NPS protected-stream ecosystems within the highly urbanized southeast region (SER) from bioactive contaminants was assessed in five systems based on 334 pesticide and pharmaceutical analytes in water and 119 pesticides in sediment. Contaminant mixtures were common across all sampled systems, with approximately 24\% of the unique analytes (80/334) detected at least once and 15\% (49/334) detected in half of the surface-water samples. Pharmaceuticals were observed more frequently than pesticides, consistent with riparian buffers and concomitant spatial separation from non-point pesticide sources in four of the systems. To extrapolate exposure data to biological effects space, site–specific cumulative exposure-activity ratios (ΣEAR) were calculated for detected surface-water contaminants with available ToxCast data; common exceedances of a 0.001 ΣEAR effects-screening threshold raise concerns for molecular toxicity and possible, sub-lethal effects to non-target, aquatic vertebrates. The results illustrate the need for continued management of protected resources to reduce contaminant exposure and preserve habitat quality, including prioritization of conservation practices (riparian buffers) near stream corridors and increased engagement with upstream/up-gradient property owners and municipal wastewater facilities.},

	abstract = {Human-use pharmaceuticals in urban streams link aquatic-ecosystem health to human health. Pharmaceutical mixtures have been widely reported in larger streams due to historical emphasis on wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) sources, with limited investigation of pharmaceutical exposures and potential effects in smaller headwater streams. In 2014–2017, the United States Geological Survey measured 111 pharmaceutical compounds in 308 headwater streams (261 urban-gradient sites sampled 3–5 times, 47 putative low-impact sites sampled once) in 4 regions across the US. Simultaneous exposures to multiple pharmaceutical compounds (pharmaceutical mixtures) were observed in 91\% of streams (248 urban-gradient, 32 low-impact), with 88 analytes detected across all sites and cumulative maximum concentrations up to 36,142 ng/L per site. Cumulative detections and concentrations correlated to urban land use and presence/absence of permitted WWTP discharges, but pharmaceutical mixtures also were common in the 75\% of sampled streams without WWTP. Cumulative exposure-activity ratios (EAR) indicated widespread transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to vertebrates. Considering the potential individual and interactive effects of the detected pharmaceuticals and the recognized analytical underestimation of the pharmaceutical-contaminant (unassessed parent compounds, metabolites, degradates) space, these results demonstrate a nation-wide environmental concern and the need for watershed-scale mitigation of in-stream pharmaceutical contamination.},
