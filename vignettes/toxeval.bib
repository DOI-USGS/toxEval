	abstract = {Several {OCs} have been detected in bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nestling (eaglet) plasma in the upper Midwestern United States. Despite frequent and relatively high concentrations of {OCs} in eaglets, little is understood about potential biological effects associated with exposure. We screened an existing database of {OC} concentrations in eaglet plasma collected from the Midwestern United States against bioactivity information from the {ToxCast} database. {ToxCast} bioactivity information consists of concentrations expected to elicit responses across a range of biological space (e.g. cellular, developmental, etc.) obtained from a series of high throughput assays. We calculated exposure—activity ratios ({EAR}) by calculating the ratio of plasma concentrations to concentrations available in {ToxCast}. Bioactivity data were not available for all detected {OCs}. Therefore, our analysis provides estimates of potential bioactivity for 19 of the detected {OCs} in eaglet plasma. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid ({PFOS}) {EAR} values were consistently the highest among all study areas. Maximum {EAR} values were ≥1 for {PFOS}, perfluorononanoic acid, and bisphenol A in 99.7, 0.53 and 0.26\% of samples, indicating that some plasma concentrations were greater than what may be expected to elicit biological responses. About 125 gene targets, indicative of specific biological pathways, were identified as potentially being affected. Inhibition of several {CYP} genes, involved in xenobiotic metabolism, were most consistently identified. Other identified biological responses have potential implications for motor coordination, cardiac functions, behavior, and blood circulation. However, it is unclear what these results mean for bald eagles, given that {ToxCast} data are generated using mammalian-based endpoints. Despite uncertainties and limitations, this method of screening environmental data can be useful for informing future monitoring or research focused on understanding the occurrence and effects of {OCs} in bald eagles and other similarly-positioned trophic species.},

	abstract = {Chemical monitoring data were collected in surface waters from 57 Great Lakes tributaries from 2010 to 13 to identify chemicals of potential biological relevance and sites at which these chemicals occur. Traditional water-quality benchmarks for aquatic life based on in vivo toxicity data were available for 34 of 67 evaluated chemicals. To expand evaluation of potential biological effects, measured chemical concentrations were compared to chemical-specific biological activities determined in high-throughput ({ToxCast}) in vitro assays. Resulting exposure-activity ratios ({EARs}) were used to prioritize the chemicals of greatest potential concern: 4‑nonylphenol, bisphenol A, metolachlor, atrazine, {DEET}, caffeine, tris(2‑butoxyethyl) phosphate, tributyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, benzo(a)pyrene, fluoranthene, and benzophenone. Water-quality benchmarks were unavailable for five of these chemicals, but for the remaining seven, {EAR}-based prioritization was consistent with that based on toxicity quotients calculated from benchmarks. Water-quality benchmarks identified three additional {PAHs} (anthracene, phenanthrene, and pyrene) not prioritized using {EARs}. Through this analysis, an {EAR} of 10−3 was identified as a reasonable threshold above which a chemical might be of potential concern. To better understand apical hazards potentially associated with biological activities captured in {ToxCast} assays, in vitro bioactivity data were matched with available adverse outcome pathway ({AOP}) information. The 49 {ToxCast} assays prioritized via {EAR} analysis aligned with 23 potentially-relevant {AOPs} present in the {AOP}-Wiki. Mixture effects at monitored sites were estimated by summation of {EAR} values for multiple chemicals by individual assay or individual {AOP}. Commonly predicted adverse outcomes included impacts on reproduction and mitochondrial function. The {EAR} approach provided a screening-level assessment for evidence-based prioritization of chemicals and sites with potential for adverse biological effects. The approach aids prioritization of future monitoring activities and provides testable hypotheses to help focus those efforts. This also expands the fraction of detected chemicals for which biologically-based benchmark concentrations are available to help contextualize chemical monitoring results.},

	abstract = {Organic chemicals from industrial, agricultural, and residential activities can enter surface waters through regulated and unregulated discharges, combined sewer overflows, stormwater runoff, accidental spills, and leaking septic-conveyance systems on a daily basis. The impact of point and nonpoint contaminant sources can result in adverse biological effects for organisms living in or near surface waters. Assessing the adverse or toxic effects that may result when exposure occurs is complicated by the fact that many commonly used chemicals lack toxicity information or water quality standards. To address these challenges, an exposure-activity ratio ({EAR}) screening approach was used to prioritize environmental chemistry data in a West Virginia watershed (Wolf Creek). Wolf Creek is a drinking water source and recreation resource with documented water quality impacts from point and nonpoint sources. The {EAR} screening approach uses high-throughput screening ({HTS}) data from {ToxCast} as a method of integrating environmental chemical occurrence and biological effects data. Using water quality schedule 4433, which targets 69 organic waste compounds typically found in domestic and industrial wastewater, chemicals were screened for potential adverse biological affects at multiple sites in the Wolf Creek watershed. Cumulative {EAR} mixture values were greatest at Sites 2 and 3, where bisphenol A ({BPA}) and pentachlorophenol exhibited maximum {EAR} values of 0.05 and 0.002, respectively. Site 2 is downstream of an unconventional oil and gas ({UOG}) wastewater disposal facility with documented water quality impacts. Low-level organic contaminants were found at all sample sites in Wolf Creek, except Site 10, where Wolf Creek enters the New River. The application of an {EAR} screening approach allowed our study to extend beyond traditional environmental monitoring methods to identify multiple sites and chemicals that warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {Complex chemical mixtures have been widely reported in larger streams but relatively little work has been done to characterize them and assess their potential effects in headwater streams. In 2014, the United States Geological Survey ({USGS}) sampled 54 Piedmont streams over ten weeks and measured 475 unique organic compounds using five analytical methods. Maximum and median exposure conditions were evaluated in relation to watershed characteristics and for potential biological effects using multiple lines of evidence. Results demonstrate that mixed-contaminant exposures are ubiquitous and varied in sampled headwater streams. Approximately 56\% (264) of the 475 compounds were detected at least once across all sites. Cumulative maximum concentrations ranged 1,922–162,346ngL−1 per site. Chemical occurrence significantly correlated to urban land use but was not related to presence/absence of wastewater treatment facility discharges. Designed bioactive chemicals represent about 2/3rd of chemicals detected, notably pharmaceuticals and pesticides, qualitative evidence for possible adverse biological effects. Comparative Toxicogenomics Database chemical-gene associations applied to maximum exposure conditions indicate {\textgreater}12,000 and 2,900 potential gene targets were predicted at least once across all sites for fish and invertebrates, respectively. Analysis of cumulative exposure-activity ratios provided additional evidence that, at a minimum, transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to vertebrates were common. Finally, cumulative detections and concentrations correlated inversely with invertebrate metrics from in-stream surveys. The results demonstrate widespread instream exposure to extensive contaminant mixtures and compelling multiple lines of evidence for adverse effects on aquatic communities.},

However, sediment quality assessment methods that consider the risks caused by the combined action of all sediment-associated contaminants to benthic biota are still underrepresented in water quality assessment strategies. Significant advancements have been made in the application of effect-based methods, but methodological improvements can still advance sediment risk assessment. The present study aimed to explore such improvements by integrating effect-monitoring and chemical profiling of sediment contamination. To this end, 28 day life cycle bioassays with Chironomus riparius using intact whole sediment cores from contaminated sites were performed in tandem with explorative chemical profiling of bioavailable concentrations of groups of legacy and emerging sediment contaminants to investigate ecotoxicological risks to benthic biota. All contaminated sediments caused effects on the resilient midge C. riparius, stressing that sediment contamination is ubiquitous and potentially harmful to aquatic ecosystems. However, bioassay responses were not in line with any of the calculated toxicity indices, suggesting that toxicity was caused by unmeasured compounds. Hence, this study underlines the relevance of effect-based sediment quality assessment and provides smarter ways to do so.},

Poor water quality in the upper Illinois Waterway may be a factor contributing to the stalling of the carp population front near river mile 278. In 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey collected 4 sets of water samples from two sites upstream and 4 sites downstream from river mile 278, and one tributary. Each sample was analyzed for up to 649 unique constituents of which 287 were detected including 96 pesticides, 62 pharmaceuticals, 39 wastewater indicator chemicals, 29 metals, 19 volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}), 6 disinfection by-products ({DBPs}), 5 hormones, and 5 carboxylic acids.

The resulting hazard quotients and exposure-activity ratios ({EARs}) are toxicity indexes that can be used to rank potential bioactivity of individual chemicals and chemical mixtures. This analysis indicates that several bioactive chemicals ({BCs}) including: carbendazim, 2,4-D, metolachlor, terbuthylazine, and acetochlor (pesticides); 1,4-dioxane ({VOC}); metformin, diphenhydramine, sulfamethoxazole, tramadol, fexofenadine, and the anti-depressants (pharmaceuticals); bisphenol A, 4-nonylphenol, galaxolide, 4-tert-octylphenol (wastewater indicator chemical); lead and boron (metals); and estrone (hormone) all occur in the upper Illinois Waterway at concentrations that produce elevated {EARs} values and may be adversely affecting carp reproduction and health.

Cumulative detections and concentrations correlated to urban land use and presence/absence of permitted {WWTP} discharges, but pharmaceutical mixtures also were common in the 75\% of sampled streams without {WWTP}. Cumulative exposure-activity ratios ({EAR}) indicated widespread transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to vertebrates.

Pharmaceuticals were observed more frequently than pesticides, consistent with riparian buffers and concomitant spatial separation from non-point pesticide sources in four of the systems. To extrapolate exposure data to biological effects space, site–specific cumulative exposure-activity ratios (Σ{EAR}) were calculated for detected surface-water contaminants with available {ToxCast} data; common exceedances of a 0.001 Σ{EAR} effects-screening threshold raise concerns for molecular toxicity and possible, sub-lethal effects to non-target, aquatic vertebrates.

Antibiotics, allergy/cold medications and analgesics were categories with the highest plasma concentrations. Fifty {PhACs}/{IDrgs} were identified as chemicals of concern based on the fish plasma model ({FPM}) effect ratios ({ER}) and their potential to activate evolutionary conserved biological targets. Chemicals of concern were also prioritized by calculating exposure-activity ratios ({EARs}) where plasma concentrations of chemicals were compared to their bioactivities in comprehensive {ToxCast} suite of in vitro assays. Overall, the applied prioritization methods indicated stimulants (nicotine, cotinine) and allergy/cold medications (prednisolone, dexamethasone) as having the highest potential biological impact on fish. The {FPM} model pointed to psychoactive substances (hallucinogens/stimulants and opioids) and psychotropic substances in the cannabinoids category (i.e. {CBD} and {THC}). {EAR} confirmed above and singled out additional chemicals of concern - anticholesteremic simvastatin and antiepileptic haloperidol. Present study demonstrates how the use of a combination of chemical analyses, and bio-effects based risk predictions with multiple criteria can help identify priority contaminants in freshwaters. The results reveal a widespread exposure of fish to complex mixtures of {PhACs}/{IDrgs}, which may target common molecular targets. While many of the prioritized chemicals occurred at low concentrations, their adverse effect on aquatic communities, due to continuous chronic exposure and additive effects, should not be neglected.},

Here, we report data from a groundwater plume consisting of a mixture of crude oil compounds and transformation products in an effort to bridge the gap between groundwater quality information and potential biological effects of human exposures. Groundwater samples were characterized for redox processes, concentrations of nonvolatile dissolved organic carbon ({NVDOC}) and total petroleum hydrocarbons in the diesel range, as well as for activation of human nuclear receptors ({hNR}) and toxicologically relevant transcriptional pathways. Results show upregulation of several biological pathways, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and alpha, estrogen receptor alpha, and pregnane X receptor ({PXR}) with higher levels of {hNR} activity observed in more contaminated samples. Our study of affected groundwater contaminated by a crude-oil release 39 years ago shows these types of waters may have the potential to cause adverse impacts on development, endocrine, and liver functioning in exposed populations. Additionally, positive trends in activation of some of the molecular targets (e.g., {PXR}) with increasing {NVDOC} concentrations (including polar transformation products) demonstrate the importance of improving our understanding of the toxicity associated with the unknown transformation products present in hydrocarbon-impacted waters. Our results begin to provide insight into the potential toxicity of petroleum-impacted waters, which is particularly timely given the ubiquitous nature of waters impacted by petroleum contamination not only recently but also in the past and the need to protect drinking-water quality.},

	abstract = {The widespread occurrence of organic micropollutants ({OMPs}) is a challenge for aquatic ecosystem management, and closing the gaps in risk assessment of {OMPs} requires a data-driven approach. One promising tool for increasing the spatiotemporal coverage of {OMP} data sets is through the active involvement of citizen volunteers to expand the scale of {OMP} monitoring. Working collaboratively with volunteers from the Citizens Statewide Lake Assessment Program ({CSLAP}), we conducted the first statewide study on {OMP} occurrence in surface waters of New York lakes. Samples collected by {CSLAP} volunteers were analyzed for {OMPs} by a suspect screening method based on mixed-mode solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Sixty-five {OMPs} were confirmed and quantified in samples from 111 lakes across New York. Hierarchical clustering of {OMP} occurrence data revealed the relevance of 11 most frequently detected {OMPs} for classifying the contamination status of lakes. Partial least squares regression and multiple linear regression analyses prioritized three water quality parameters linked to agricultural and developed land uses (i.e., total dissolved nitrogen, specific conductance, and a wastewater-derived fluorescent organic matter component) as the best combination of predictors that partly explained the interlake variability in {OMP} occurrence. Lastly, the exposure-activity ratio approach identified the potential for biological effects associated with detected {OMPs} that warrant further biomonitoring studies. Overall, this work demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating citizen science approaches into the regional impact assessment of {OMPs}.},

We characterized micropollutant concentrations in daily composite samples from the Fall Creek Monitoring Station over 18 months. These data were compiled alongside environmental covariates, including daily measurements of weather, hydrology, and water quality parameters, to generate a novel data set with high temporal resolution. We evaluated the temporal trends of several representative micropollutants, along with cumulative metrics of overall micropollutant contamination, by means of multivariable analyses to determine which combination of covariates best predicts micropollutant dynamics and peak events. Peak events of agriculture-derived micropollutants were best predicted by positive associations with turbidity and {UV}254 absorbance and negative associations with baseflow index. Peak events of wastewater-derived micropollutants were best predicted by positive associations with alkalinity and negative associations with streamflow rate. We demonstrate that these predictors can be used to inform intermittent sampling strategies aimed at capturing peak events, and we generalize the approach so that it could be applied in other watersheds. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to contextualize micropollutant data derived from infrequent grab samples.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have detected numerous organic contaminants and in vitro bioactivities in surface water from the South Platte River near Denver, Colorado, {USA}. To evaluate the temporal and spatial distribution of selected contaminants of emerging concern, water samples were collected throughout 2018 and 2019 at 11 sites within the S. Platte River and surrounding tributaries with varying proximities to a major wastewater treatment plant ({WWTP}). Water samples were analyzed for pharmaceuticals, pesticides, steroid hormones, and wastewater indicators and screened for in vitro biological activities. Multiplexed, in vitro assays that simultaneously screen for agonistic activity against 24 human nuclear receptors detected estrogen receptor ({ER}), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma ({PPARγ}), and glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}) bioactivities in water samples near the {WWTP} outflow. Targeted in vitro bioassays assessing {ER}, {GR}, and {PPARγ} agonism corroborated bioactivities for {ER} (up to 55 ± 9.7 ng/L 17β-estradiol equivalents) and {GR} (up to 156 ± 28 ng/L dexamethasone equivalents), while {PPARγ} activity was not confirmed. To evaluate the potential in vivo significance of the bioactive contaminants, sexually-mature fathead minnows were caged at six locations upstream and downstream of the {WWTP} for 5 days after which targeted gene expression analyses were performed. Significant up-regulation of male hepatic vitellogenin was observed at sites with corresponding in vitro {ER} activity. No site-related differences in {GR}-related transcript abundance were detected in female adipose or male livers, suggesting observed environmental concentrations of {GR}-active contaminants do not induce a detectable in vivo response. In line with the lack of detectable targeted in vitro {PPARɣ} activity, there were no significant effects on {PPARɣ}-related gene expression. Although the chemicals responsible for {GR} and {PPAR}-mediated bioactivities are unknown, results from the present study provide insights into the significance (or lack thereof) of these bioactivities relative to short-term in situ fish exposures.},

We describe the use of pathway-based chemical and biological approaches to assess the risk of chemical mixtures in the Maumee River ({OH}, {USA}), which receives a variety of agricultural and urban inputs. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were deployed in cages for 4 d at a gradient of sites along the river and adjoining tributaries in 2012 and during 2 periods (April and June) in 2016, in conjunction with an automated system to collect composite water samples. More than 100 industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides were detected in water at some of the study sites, with the greatest number typically found near domestic wastewater treatment plants. In 2016, there was an increase in concentrations of several herbicides from April to June at upstream agricultural sites. A comparison of chemical concentrations in site water with single chemical data from vitro high-throughput screening ({HTS}) assays suggested the potential for perturbation of multiple biological pathways, including several associated with induction or inhibition of different cytochrome P450 ({CYP}) isozymes. This was consistent with direct effects of water extracts in an {HTS} assay and induction of hepatic {CYPs} in caged fish. Targeted in vitro assays and measurements in the caged fish suggested minimal effects on endocrine function (e.g., estrogenicity). A nontargeted mass spectroscopy-based analysis suggested that hepatic endogenous metabolite profiles in caged fish covaried strongly with the occurrence of pesticides and pesticide degradates. These studies demonstrate the application of an integrated suite of measurements to help understand the effects of complex chemical mixtures in the field.

A risk‐based screening approach was used to prioritize chemicals and chemical mixtures, identify sites at greatest risk for biological impacts, and identify potential hazards to monitor at those sites. Analyses included 185 chemicals (143 detected) including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}), legacy and current‐use pesticides, fire retardants, pharmaceuticals, and fragrances. Hazard quotients were calculated by dividing detected concentrations by biological effect concentrations reported in the {ECOTOX} Knowledgebase (toxicity quotients) or {ToxCast} database (exposure–activity ratios [{EARs}]). Mixture effects were estimated by summation of {EAR} values for chemicals that influence {ToxCast} assays with common gene targets. Nineteen chemicals—atrazine, N,N‐diethyltoluamide, di(2‐ethylhexyl)phthalate, dl‐menthol, galaxolide, p‐tert‐octylphenol, 3 organochlorine pesticides, 3 {PAHs}, 4 pharmaceuticals, and 3 phosphate flame retardants—had toxicity quotients {\textgreater}0.1 or {EARs} for individual chemicals {\textgreater}10–3 at 10\% or more of the sites monitored. An additional 4 chemicals (tributyl phosphate, triethyl citrate, benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[b]fluoranthene) were present in mixtures with {EARs} {\textgreater}10–3. To evaluate potential apical effects and biological endpoints to monitor in exposed wildlife, in vitro bioactivity data were compared to adverse outcome pathway gene ontology information. Endpoints and effects associated with endocrine disruption, alterations in xenobiotic metabolism, and potentially neuronal development would be relevant to monitor at the priority sites. The {EAR} threshold exceedance for many chemical classes was correlated with urban land cover and wastewater effluent influence, whereas herbicides and fire retardants were also correlated to agricultural land cover.

Pollution profiles of five sampling sites along the River Sava were assessed by simultaneous chemical analysis of 562 organic contaminants ({OCs}) of which 476 were detected. At each sampling site, pharmaceuticals/illicit drugs category was mostly represented by their cumulative concentration, followed by categories industrial chemicals, pesticides and hormones. An exposure-activity ratio ({EAR}) approach based on {ToxCast} data highlighted steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antiepileptics/neuroleptics, industrial chemicals and hormones as compounds with the highest biological potential. Summed {EAR}-based prediction of toxicity showed a good correlation with the estimated toxicity of assessed sampling sites using {WOBs}. {WOBs} did not exhibit increased mortality but caused various sub-lethal biological responses that were dependant relative to the sampling site pollution intensity as well as species sensitivity.

Zebrafish D. rerio embryo exhibited a significant decrease in heartbeat rate, failure in pigmentation formation, as well as inhibition of {ABC} transporters. Nuclear receptor activation was indicated as the biological target of greatest concern based on the {EAR} approach. A combined approach of short-term {WOBs}, with a special emphasis on sub-lethal endpoints, and chemical characterization of water samples compared against in vitro toxicity data from the {ToxCast} database and {RQs} can provide a comprehensive insight into the negative effect of pollutants on aquatic organisms.},

Several medaka exposed to the {SPMD} extract from the inner harbor as well as a positive control compound, benzo[a]pyrene, developed yolk sac edema. However, whitefish did not show the same response. Overall, these data indicate this contamination could contribute to toxicity in sensitive species. The coupling of passive sampling and in vivo bioassays with early life stages of fish shows promise as a method to assess the potential for risks from biologically available fractions of organic contaminants in water.

To fill this gap, we conducted the first statewide spatiotemporal assessment of {PFAS} in Iowa streams across a region of intense agricultural activity. At least one {PFAS} was detected at 19 of the 60 stream sites sampled (32\%) with 10 different {PFAS} detected statewide. The number of {PFAS} detected in the stream samples ranged from one to nine. While {PFAS} were detected in agricultural streams, sites with the most {PFAS} detected and in the highest concentration were small, effluent-affected streams where wastewater treatment plant discharge is driving stream {PFAS} concentrations. No individual {PFAS} had an exposure:activity ratio ({EAR}) of {\textgreater}1.0 (exposure concentration shown to trigger observed adverse biological activity).

	abstract = {Background
Humans are primary drivers of environmental contamination worldwide, including in drinking-water resources. In the United States ({US}), federal and state agencies regulate and monitor public-supply drinking water while private-supply monitoring is rare; the current lack of directly comparable information on contaminant-mixture exposures and risks between private- and public-supplies undermines tapwater ({TW}) consumer decision-making.
Methods
We compared private- and public-supply residential point-of-use {TW} at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where both supplies share the same groundwater source. {TW} from 10 private- and 10 public-supply homes was analyzed for 487 organic, 38 inorganic, 8 microbial indicators, and 3 in vitro bioactivities. Concentrations were compared to existing protective health-based benchmarks, and aggregated Hazard Indices ({HI}) of regulated and unregulated {TW} contaminants were calculated along with ratios of in vitro exposure-activity cutoffs.
Results
Seventy organic and 28 inorganic constituents were detected in {TW}. Median detections were comparable, but median cumulative concentrations were substantially higher in public supply due to 6 chlorine–disinfected samples characterized by disinfection byproducts and corresponding lower heterotrophic plate counts. Public-supply applicable maximum contaminant (nitrate) and treatment action (lead and copper) levels were exceeded in private-supply {TW} samples only. Exceedances of health-based {HI} screening levels of concern were common to both {TW} supplies.
Discussion
These Cape Cod results indicate comparable cumulative human-health concerns from contaminant exposures in private- and public-supply {TW} in a shared source-water setting. Importantly, although this study’s analytical coverage exceeds that currently feasible for water purveyors or homeowners, it nevertheless is a substantial underestimation of the full breadth of contaminant mixtures documented in the environment and potentially present in drinking water.
Conclusion
Regardless of the supply, increased public engagement in source-water protection and drinking-water treatment, including consumer point-of-use treatment, is warranted to reduce risks associated with long-term {TW} contaminant exposures, especially in vulnerable populations.},

In this work, we combined suspect and nontarget screening with mass balance modeling to investigate {OMP} contamination in the Onondaga Lake–Three Rivers system of New York. Suspect and nontarget screening enabled by liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry led to the confirmation and quantification of 105 {OMPs} in water samples collected throughout the lake–river system, which were grouped by their concentration patterns into wastewater-derived and mixed-source clusters via hierarchical cluster analysis. Four of these {OMPs} (i.e., galaxolidone, diphenylphosphinic acid, N-butylbenzenesulfonamide, and triisopropanolamine) were prioritized and identified by nontarget screening based on their characteristic vertical distribution patterns during thermal stratification in Onondaga Lake. Mass balance modeling performed using the concentration and discharge data highlighted the export of {OMPs} from Onondaga Lake to the Three Rivers as a major contributor to the {OMP} budget in this lake–river system. Overall, this work demonstrated the utility of an integrated screening and modeling framework that can be adapted for {OMP} characterization, fate assessment, and load apportionment in similar surface water systems.},

In the present study, we deployed semi-permeable membrane devices ({SPMDs}) above sediments in a contaminated harbor at a location in the Laurentian Great Lakes (i.e. Owen Sound Bay) and prepared extracts from these passive samplers for analysis of organic contaminants and for toxicity testing using early life stages of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). The concentrations of several classes of organic contaminants estimated from analysis of the {SPMD} extracts indicated that several polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ({PAHs}) were present in the water column in the inner harbor of Owen Sound Bay at concentrations higher than water quality standards for the protection of aquatic life. Several medaka exposed to the {SPMD} extract from the inner harbor as well as a positive control compound, benzo[a]pyrene, developed yolk sac edema. However, whitefish did not show the same response. Overall, these data indicate this contamination could contribute to toxicity in sensitive species. The coupling of passive sampling and in vivo bioassays with early life stages of fish shows promise as a method to assess the potential for risks from biologically available fractions of organic contaminants in water. A novel aspect of the present study is the development of a bioassay procedure with early life stages of lake whitefish involving exposures at low temperatures over durations of time that are longer than the bioassays with more conventional model fish species.},

The robust nature of the {VI} was tested to evaluate the underlying statistical model and expand the spatial domain of the index. Data collected at 131 new sampling sites (Test 1) and published data from independent studies (Test 2) were used to test the model predictions. Test 1 water and sediment samples were analyzed for the same classes of {CEC} chemicals and compared to the predictions for the original {VI}. Concentrations and numbers of unique {CECs} detected in water and sediment samples were similar between the original data and the two test datasets, although {CECs} tended to have higher detection frequencies in the original dataset compared to the Test 1 and Test 2 datasets. For example, 69 {CECs} were detected in ≥30\% of water samples in the original dataset compared with 17 {CECs} in the Test 1 data and 59 in the Test 2 data. Predicted vulnerability for test sites agreed with actual vulnerability 64\% of the time for water and 71\% of the time for sediment. Agreement percentage results were greater when individual sites were grouped by river, with 82\% agreement between predictions and actual vulnerability for water and 78\% agreement for sediment. For the entire dataset, the {VI} ranks correlated with an independent estimate of potential biological impact. Agreement percentage was the greatest for low or high vulnerability index values but highly variable for sites that are classified as having medium vulnerability. Despite the underlying variability, there is a significant correlation (R2 = 0.26; p {\textless} 0.01) between the {VI} ranking of tributaries and the independent ranking of potential negative biological impact.},

During 2014–2017, the U.S. Geological Survey ({USGS}) measured 389 unique organic analytes (pharmaceutical, pesticide, organic wastewater indicators) in 305 headwater streams within four contiguous United States ({US}) regions. Potential aquatic biological effects were evaluated for estimated maximum and median exposure conditions using multiple lines of evidence, including occurrence/concentrations of designed-bioactive pesticides and pharmaceuticals and cumulative risk screening based on vertebrate-centric {ToxCast}™ exposure-response data and on invertebrate and nonvascular plant aquatic life benchmarks. Mixed-contaminant exposures were ubiquitous and varied, with 78\% (304) of analytes detected at least once and cumulative maximum concentrations up to more than 156,000 ng/L. Designed bioactives represented 83\% of detected analytes. Contaminant summary metrics correlated strong-positive (rho (ρ): 0.569–0.719) to multiple watershed-development metrics, only weak-positive to point-source discharges (ρ: 0.225–353), and moderate- to strong-negative with multiple instream invertebrate metrics (ρ: −0.373 to −0.652). Risk screening indicated common exposures with high probability of vertebrate-centric molecular effects and of acute toxicity to invertebrates, respectively. The results confirm exposures to broad and diverse contaminant mixtures and provide convincing multiple lines of evidence that chemical contaminants contribute substantially to adverse multi-stressor effects in headwater-stream communities.},

Hazard quotients based on acute aquatic-life benchmarks for invertebrates and nonvascular plants and vertebrate-centric molecular endpoints (sublethal effects) quantify the range of the potential contribution of {TPs} to environmental risk and highlight several {TP} exposure–response data gaps.

However, these are underrepresented in assessments of pollution from contaminants of emerging concern ({CEC}). Furthermore, freshwater streams and their endemic fauna often have characteristics that are distinct from those of continental streams and model species, calling extrapolations from studies of such systems into question for island streams. In the current study, we assessed the presence of {CEC} across three sampling events and five freshwater streams on the Island of Hawai’i. We also exposed juveniles of the native fish species Sicyopterus stimpsoni to a mixture of commonly co-occurring {CEC} for 96 h in static renewal experiments, testing for impacts of {CEC} in two ecologically relevant assays of functional performance. {CEC} from multiple sources were ubiquitous in Hawaiian streams, including human-use pharmaceuticals, agricultural herbicides, and industrial runoff. Concentrations of {CEC} were comparable to published studies from continental streams, exceeding total concentrations of 1000 ng/L for the eight quantified {CEC} in four samples, and approaching 2500 ng/L in one sample. Effects on exposed fish were subtle and limited to treatments with higher {CEC} concentrations but indicated potential impacts of {CEC} on locomotor performance. These results indicate that Hawaiian streams follow a global trend of widespread freshwater pollution by {CEC} that are accompanied by subtle effects on native fish species and highlight the need for the inclusion of endemic species and ecologically relevant assays when assessing the effects of contaminants in island habitats.},

	abstract = {The United States ({US}) National Park Service ({NPS}) manages protected public lands to preserve biodiversity. Exposure to and effects of bioactive organic contaminants in {NPS} streams are challenges for resource managers. Recent assessment of pesticides and pharmaceuticals in protected-streams within the urbanized {NPS} Southeast Region ({SER}) indicated the importance of fluvial inflows from external sources as drivers of aquatic contaminant-mixture exposures. Great Smoky Mountains National Park ({GRSM}), lies within {SER}, has the highest biodiversity and annual visitation of {NPS} parks, but, in contrast to the previously studied systems, straddles a high-elevation hydrologic divide; this setting limits fluvial-inflows of contaminants but potentially increases visitation-driven contaminant deliveries. We leveraged the unique characteristics of {GRSM} to test further the importance of fluvial contaminant inflows as drivers of protected-stream exposures and to inform the relative importance of potential additional contaminant transport mechanisms, by comparing the estimated risks of 328 pesticides and pharmaceuticals in water at 16 {GRSM} stream locations to those estimated previously in {SER} streams. Extensive mixtures (31 compounds) were only observed in an atypical reach on the boundary of {GRSM} downstream of a wastewater discharge, while limited mixtures (2–5 compounds) were observed in one stream with elevated visitation pressure (recreational “tube floating”). The insecticide, imidacloprid, used to eradicate hemlock woolly adelgid, was detected in 8 (50\%) streams. Infrequent exceedances of a cumulative {ToxCast}-based, exposure-activity ratio (Σ{EAR}) 0.001 screening-level of concern suggested limited risk to non-target, aquatic vertebrates, whereas exceedances of a cumulative benchmark-based, invertebrate toxicity quotient (Σ{TQ}) 0.1 screening level at 8 locations indicated generally high risk to invertebrates. The results are consistent with the importance of fluvial transport from extra-park sources as a driver of bioactive-contaminant mixture exposures in protected streams and illustrate the potential additional risks from visitation-driven and tactical-use-pesticides.},

	abstract = {Organic micropollutants ({OMPs}) are contaminants of global concern and have garnered increasing attention in Africa, particularly in urban and urbanizing areas of sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}). In this work, we coupled suspect screening enabled by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry ({LC}-{HRMS}) with multivariate analysis to characterize {OMPs} in wastewater, surface water, and groundwater samples collected from Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. Suspect screening prioritized and confirmed 157 {OMPs} in Kampala samples for target quantification. Many {OMPs} detected in Kampala samples occurred within concentration ranges similar to those documented in previous studies reporting {OMP} occurrence in {SSA}, but some have never or rarely been quantified in environmental water samples from {SSA}. Hierarchical cluster analysis established the source-related co-occurrence profiles of {OMPs}. Partial least squares regression and multiple linear regression analyses further pinpointed the concentration of nitrate and the content of a fluorescent organic matter component with excitation/emission maxima around 280/330 nm as predictors for the sample-specific cumulative concentrations of {OMPs}, suggesting the likely contribution of diffuse runoff and wastewater discharges to {OMP} occurrence in the aquatic environment of Kampala. Parallel calculations of exposure-activity ratios and multi-substance potentially affected fractions provided insights into the potential for biological effects associated with {OMPs} and highlighted the importance of expanded analytical coverage for screening-level risk assessments. Overall, our study demonstrates a versatile database-driven screening and data analysis methodology for the multipronged characterization of {OMP} contamination in a representative {SSA} urban center.},

	abstract = {To help meet the objectives of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative with regard to increasing knowledge about toxic substances, 223 pesticides and pesticide transformation products were monitored in 15 Great Lakes tributaries using polar organic chemical integrative samplers. A screening-level assessment of their potential for biological effects was conducted by computing toxicity quotients ({TQs}) for chemicals with available {US} Environmental Protection Agency ({USEPA}) Aquatic Life Benchmark values. In addition, exposure activity ratios ({EAR}) were calculated using information from the {USEPA} {ToxCast} database. Between 16 and 81 chemicals were detected per site, with 97 unique compounds detected overall, for which 64 could be assessed using {TQs} or {EARs}. Ten chemicals exceeded {TQ} or {EAR} levels of concern at two or more sites. Chemicals exceeding thresholds included seven herbicides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, diuron, metolachlor, acetochlor, atrazine, simazine, and sulfentrazone), a transformation product (deisopropylatrazine), and two insecticides (fipronil and imidacloprid). Watersheds draining agricultural and urban areas had more detections and higher concentrations of pesticides compared with other land uses. Chemical mixtures analysis for {ToxCast} assays associated with common modes of action defined by gene targets and adverse outcome pathways ({AOP}) indicated potential activity on biological pathways related to a range of cellular processes, including xenobiotic metabolism, extracellular signaling, endocrine function, and protection against oxidative stress. Use of gene ontology databases and the {AOP} knowledgebase within the R-package {ToxMixtures} highlighted the utility of {ToxCast} data for identifying and evaluating potential biological effects and adverse outcomes of chemicals and mixtures. Results have provided a list of high-priority chemicals for future monitoring and potential biological effects warranting further evaluation in laboratory and field environments.

	abstract = {Watersheds of the Great Lakes Basin ({USA}/Canada) are highly modified and impacted by human activities including pesticide use. Despite labeling restrictions intended to minimize risks to nontarget organisms, concerns remain that environmental exposures to pesticides may be occurring at levels negatively impacting nontarget organisms. We used a combination of organismal-level toxicity estimates (in vivo aquatic life benchmarks) and data from high-throughput screening ({HTS}) assays (in vitro benchmarks) to prioritize pesticides and sites of concern in streams at 16 tributaries to the Great Lakes Basin. In vivo or in vitro benchmark values were exceeded at 15 sites, 10 of which had exceedances throughout the year. Pesticides had the greatest potential biological impact at the site with the greatest proportion of agricultural land use in its basin (the Maumee River, Toledo, {OH}, {USA}), with 72 parent compounds or transformation products being detected, 47 of which exceeded at least one benchmark value. Our risk-based screening approach identified multiple pesticide parent compounds of concern in tributaries of the Great Lakes; these compounds included: eight herbicides (metolachlor, acetochlor, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, diuron, atrazine, alachlor, triclopyr, and simazine), three fungicides (chlorothalonil, propiconazole, and carbendazim), and four insecticides (diazinon, fipronil, imidacloprid, and clothianidin). We present methods for reducing the volume and complexity of potential biological effects data that result from combining contaminant surveillance with {HTS} (in vitro) and traditional (in vivo) toxicity estimates.

	abstract = {Organic micropollutants ({OMPs}) are contaminants of global concern and have garnered increasing attention in Africa, particularly in urban and urbanizing areas of Sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}). In this work, we coupled suspect screening enabled by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry ({LC}-{HRMS}) with multivariate analysis to characterize {OMPs} in wastewater, surface water, and groundwater samples collected from Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. Suspect screening prioritized and confirmed 157 {OMPs} in Kampala samples for target quantification. Many {OMPs} detected in Kampala samples occurred within concentration ranges similar to those documented in previous studies reporting {OMP} occurrence in {SSA}, but some have never or rarely been quantified in environmental water samples from {SSA}. Hierarchical cluster analysis established the source-related co-occurrence profiles of {OMPs}. Partial least squares regression and multiple linear regression analyses further pinpointed the concentration of nitrate and the content of a fluorescent organic matter component with excitation/emission maxima around 280/330 nm as predictors for the sample-specific cumulative concentrations of {OMPs}, suggesting the likely contribution of diffuse runoff and wastewater discharges to {OMP} occurrence in the aquatic environment of Kampala. Parallel calculations of exposure-activity ratios and multi-substance potentially affected fractions provided insights into the potential for biological effects associated with {OMPs} and highlighted the importance of expanded analytical coverage for screening-level risk assessments. Overall, our study demonstrates a versatile database-driven screening and data analysis methodology for the multipronged characterization of {OMP} contamination in a representative {SSA} urban center.},
