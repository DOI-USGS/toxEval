This article will walk through prepping your data and exporting it to a Microsoft&trade; Excel file using R. This article will focus on using functions and techniques from the "tidyverse" collection of R packages (`dplyr` + `tidyr` + many others...). 

## Pivot from wide to long

It is very common for environmental chemistry data to come back from the laboratory in a "wide" format. A wide format typically has a few "header" columns such as site and date with additional columns representing a sigle chemical per column and possibly a remark code for each chemical as a separate column. The remark column could indicate censored data (ie "below detection limit") or some information about the sampling conditions. We can use the `tidyr` package to "pivot" this data to the required long format used in `toxEval`.

Let's make a small data set with 3 chemicals and 2 sampling sites. Each chemical has a value column and a remark column.

```{r setupData}
data_example <- data.frame(
  site = c("A","A","B","B"),
  date = as.Date(Sys.Date():(Sys.Date()-3), 
                 origin = "1970-01-01"),
  a_value = c(1:4),
  a_rmk = c("<","","",""),
  b_value = c(4:1),
  b_rmk = c("","","","<"),
  c_value = c(3:6),
  c_rmk = rep("",4),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  
)
data_example

```


We will now use the "pivot_longer" function to make this wide data frame into a long data frame with the columns site, date, chemical, remark. The "names_to" can only be a vector if we can use the "names_pattern" to logically separate the column names.

```{r pivot1}
library(tidyr)
data_wide <- data_example %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-site, -date), 
               names_to = c("Chemical", ".value"),
               names_pattern = "(.+)_(.+)")

head(data_wide)

```

What if the column names didn't have the "_value" prepended? This is more common in our raw data:

```{r setupData2}
data_example2 <- data.frame(
  site = c("A","A","B","B"),
  date = as.Date(Sys.Date():(Sys.Date()-3), 
                 origin = "1970-01-01"),
  a = c(1:4),
  a_rmk = c("<","","",""),
  b = c(4:1),
  b_rmk = c("","","","<"),
  c = c(3:6),
  c_rmk = rep("",4),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
data_example2

```

The easiest way to do that would be to add that "_value". Keeping in the "tidyverse":

```{r change_names}
library(dplyr)

data_wide2 <- data_example2 %>% 
  rename_if(!grepl("_rmk", names(.)) &
              names(.) != c("site","date"), 
            list(~ sprintf('%s_value', .))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-site, -date), 
               names_to = c("Chemical", ".value"),
               names_pattern = "(.+)_(.+)")

head(data_wide2)

```


## Opening the file

To open an Excel file in R, use the `readxl` package. There are many different configurations of Excel files possible.

As one example, let's say the lab returned the data looking like this:

```{r tabIMAGE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("messyData.png")
```

Let's break down the issues:

* Top row contains the CAS
* 2nd row basically contains the useful column headers
* Need to skip a random 3rd row
* 4th row has 2 column headers for the first 2 columns
* The data starts in row 5, in a "wide" format
* The date format is unusual

In this example, we'll work through these spacing and header issues to get us to a wide data frame that we can then pivot to a long data frame as described in the next section.

First, let's just get the data with no column names:

```{r basicData}
library(readxl)
data_no_header <- read_xlsx(here::here("vignettes/Wide data example.xlsx"),
                            sheet = "data_from_lab", 
                            skip = 4, col_names = FALSE)

```

`data_no_header` is now a data frame with accurate types (except for dates...we'll get that later!), but no column names. We know the first 2 columns are site and date, so we can name those easily:

```{r basicDataFirstNames}
names(data_no_header)[1:2] <- c("SiteID", "Sample Date")
```

Now we need to get the CAS values for the column names:

```{r secondPart}
headers <- read_xlsx(here::here("vignettes/Wide data example.xlsx"),
                     sheet = "data_from_lab", 
                     n_max = 1)
# Get rid or first 2 columns:
headers <- headers[,-1:-2]
# Let's look at the first 6 columns:
headers[1,1:6]
```

It would be nice to use the first row as the column names in "data_no_header", but then it would be very confusing what "Code" means (since it's repeated). So, let's remove the "Code", and just repeat the chemical names:

```{r cleanupNames}
headers <- headers[,which(as.character(headers[1,]) != "Code")]

chem_names <- as.character(headers[1,])

column_names <- rep(chem_names, each = 2)
column_names <- paste0(column_names, c("_code","_Value"))

head(column_names)

```

Now, we can assign the "column_names" to the "data_no_header":

```{r almostThere}
names(data_no_header)[-1:-2] <- column_names

```

Before we pivot this data to the required long format (as described above), let's transform the "Sample Date" column to an R date time format:

```{r dateStuff}
data_no_header$`Sample Date` <- as.POSIXct(data_no_header$`Sample Date`, 
                                format = "%Y%m%d%H%M")

```

Now let's pivot this to the long format:

```{r pivotReal}
cleaned_long <- data_no_header %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-SiteID, -`Sample Date`), 
               names_to = c("Chemical", ".value"),
               names_pattern = "(.+)_(.+)") 

```

But, since we're doing a `toxEval` analysis, we need to get a "CAS" column. We can use the original "headers" data frame and do a `left_join` (from the "dplyr" package):

```{r joinCAS}

cas_df <- data.frame(Chemical = as.character(headers[1,]),
                     CAS = names(headers), 
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

cleaned_long <- cleaned_long %>% 
  left_join(cas_df, by = "Chemical")
head(cleaned_long)

```

The "cleaned_long" data frame is ready to be used by `toxEval` in the "Data" tab. The "cas_df" is nearly ready for the "Chemical" tab. There is a mandatory "Class" column that needs to be added after exporting to Excel. Finally, we need to create the "Sites" tab.

```{r lastCleanup}
chemical_tab <- cas_df %>% 
  mutate(Class = "to_add")

sites_tab <- cleaned_long %>% 
  select(SiteID) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  mutate(`Short Name` = "to_add",
         dec_lat = NA,
         dec_lon = NA,
         site_grouping = "")


```

## Save to Excel

The package `openxlsx` can be used to export Excel files. Create a named list in R, and each of those parts of the list become a Worksheet in Excel:

```{r finalForm, eval=FALSE}

to_Excel <- list(Data = cleaned_long,
                 Chemicals = chemical_tab,
                 Sites = sites_tab)

library(openxlsx)
write.xlsx(to_Excel,
           file = "toxEval_Input.xlsx")

```
