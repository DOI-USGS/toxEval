The ToxCast database does a good job flagging dose-response curves that may be unreliable or inconsistent. However, the flags should not be the only source for chemical-endpoint exclusions. If you've got a chemical with an extremely large EAR, it is a good idea to check the dose-response curve. There are two ways to get that information described here.

## Comptox Dashboard

There is a tool, the [Comptox Dashboard](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard) that allows you to search for a chemical by systematic name, synonym, CAS number, DTXSID, or InChIKey. Since we focus on CAS in the `toxEval` inputs, let's explore Atrazine (CAS = 1912-24-9):

```{r getAtrazine, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("startSearch.png")
```


After inputting the CAS, you will be taken to a page on the specific chemical. There is a TON of great information there.

```{r getAtrazineAllActive, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("allActive.png")
```

1. Click the "Bioactivity" sidebar option, then the ToxCast/ToxCast21 option.
2. Click the "Active" check box to see all of the dose response curves that would be included in `toxEval`.


To get to a specific dose-response curves:

```{r getAtrazineCurve, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("getCurve.png")
```


1. Click the "Bioactivity" sidebar option, then the ToxCast/ToxCast21 option. 
2. Paste the specific endpoint that you are concerned about in the search box
3. Click the endpoint's check box

## R-package: tcpl

There is another way to locally produce the dose-response curves using the [`tcpl` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tcpl/index.html). The nice part of this approach is that you can customize the plots and order of plots. The drawback is you need to download a very large MySQL database and have it running locally. 

If the database has been downloaded, and MySQL is up-and-running, the following code would produce a single dose-response curve. Let's look at Atrazine with the "NVS_ENZ_hPDE4A1" endpoint:

```{r exampleTCPL, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tcpl)

tcplConf(drvr = "MySQL", 
         user = "my_awesome_username",
         pass = "my_awesome_password",
         host = "localhost", 
         db = "database_name")

ep <- "NVS_ENZ_hPDE4A1"
cas <- "1912-24-9"

chem_info <- tcplLoadChem(field = 'casn', val = cas)

assay_info <- tcplLoadAcid(fld = "acnm", val = ep)

mc3 <- tcplLoadData(lvl = 3, type = "mc", 
             fld = c("acid","spid"), 
             val = list(assay_info$acid,
                        chem_info$spid))

## Load mc tables from levels of interest
mc4 <- tcplLoadData(lvl = 4, type = "mc", 
                    fld = c("spid", "aeid"), 
                    val = list(chem_info$spid,
                               unique(mc3$aeid)))

tcplPlotM4ID(mc4, lvl = 5)

```

```{r plotAtrazineCurve, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("atrazineDose.png")
```


The values passed to the `tcplConf` function will depend on how you set up the MySQL database.
