CRAN submissions:
  1. Turn off DT tables in basicWorkflow
  2. Turn dontrun to donttest in explore_endpoints
    (nevermind...removed the example altogether)
  3. Remove badge links from readme
    (badges made it in last update, so maybe they are OK)
  4. Remove most extraneous links from readme (especially installation)
