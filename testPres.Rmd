## Overview
* Topic 1
* Topic 2
* Topic 3

## Objectives
* Evaluate Great Lakes tributaries for adverse biological impact based on water chemistry monitoring data
    * Water chemistry and passive sampler data 
    * Compare water chemistry and passive sampler data to bioassay endpoints
        * ToxCast^TM^
        * Water quality guidelines
        * Estrogenic equivalents
    * Characterize sites based on potential adverse impact
    * Prioritize contaminants based on prevalence of potential adverse impact
