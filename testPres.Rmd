## Overview
* 58 Great Lakes Tributaries sampled from 2010-2013 for GLRI
* Trace organic compounds measured in samples
* Sampling methods used: Water samples and passive samplers
* Adverse biological effect potential based on chemistry results
    * Sites with greatest potential
    * Chemicals with greatest potential
* Different methods for biological effect evaluation
    * ToxCast-based evaluation
    * Water quality guideline-based evaluation
    * Comparison of these two methods

## Screening Endpoints Used in Analysis
* ToxCast: 
    * "High throughput screening assays"
        * Expose living cells or isolated protiens
        * Screens for potential adverse biological effects
        * Much is focused on gaining information on biological pathways
    * 1860 compounds
    * 821 endpoints
    * AC50 used for this analysis (concentration at which activity is 50% of its maximum)
* Water quality guidelines
    * Water sample analysis (not complete for passive samplers yet)
        * Established water quality guidelines
            * USEPA
            * Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment
            * USGS
            * Literature

## Challenges with this work
* Detection levels
    * ToxCast: Some compounds have adverse effects lower than analytical reporting limits
    * Water samples
        * Dichlorvos  (min EAR = 36)
        * Metolachlor (min EAR = 14)
        * Cotinine    (min EAR = 7)
        * Naphthalene (min EAR = 1.7)
        * dl-Menthol  (min EAR = 1.4)
* Compounds included
    * The numbers are increasing, but many are still not included
        * ToxCast and water quality guidelines/literature
* Interpretation of ToxCast in the environmental setting
        
## Work Remaining For This Analysis
* ToxCast
    * Chemical mixtures: how to evaluate within ToxCast results 
    * Zebrafish developmental toxicity testing (subset of ToxCast chemicals)
* Passive samplers
    * Compile established water quality guidelines and compare
        * Toxicity
        * Endocrine disruptors
* Endocrine disruptors
    * Comparison of estrogenic equivalents to ToxCast results
* Factors that may influence biological effects
    * Seasonality
    * Hydrologic condition
    * Land use
* Use all methods to summarize potential effects
    * By site
    * By Chemical
* ToxCast direct environmental sample analysis
    * Comparison with analysis using water chemistry data alone with ToxCast
    
## Summary
* Multiple methods can be used to evaluate potential biological effects
* Different conclusions may be reached based on methods
* Combining methods:
    * Note commonalities and differences in final evaluations
* Adverse effect potential exists and urban and agricultural sites
* Multiple contaminant classes could be influential
* The classes that appear to be of largest concern include:
    * PAHs
    * Pesticides
    * Pharmaceuticals
* Keep in mind the limited chemicals and classes included here
* Much work yet to be done to better understand how to use these methods effectively
